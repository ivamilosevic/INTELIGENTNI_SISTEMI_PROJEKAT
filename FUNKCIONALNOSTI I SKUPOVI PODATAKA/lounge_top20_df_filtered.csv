Air Canada,"Travellers are warned that the Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge at Calgary Intl Airport is undergoing construction. Based on our visit, this is an understatement. We visited the lounge in mid-July 2015 to be greeted by an experience of very poor seating, meagre food offerings and overcrowding. Even restrooms were only limitedly available, due to cleaning which went on for quite some time. In some cases, an airport may offer venues so peaceful and reasonable that it pays to visit them instead of using the airline lounge. The Maple Leaf Lounge at Calgary international exemplifies a second situation where the lounge is so inadequate and overcrowded that even poor airport venues make for a better place to wait for flights. Lounge personnel here were more interested in surfing the Internet than assisting airline customers with questions about connections or required services.",Calgary Airport,2.0,1,1,3.3,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no
Air Canada,"A nice lounge, with nice view of the tarmac. 2 soups on choice, Dips, as well as salads and sandwiches. Self serve soft drinks and alcohol. Have a kid zone, business center. I can see it can be crowded. Only accessible via elevators. No stairs. So take extra time before leaving the lounge to get to your gate. Better than any Delta, American, United lounges. Still weaker than average premium lounge in Europe.",Toronto Pearson Airport,6.0,4,3,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Air Canada,The terminal is under renovation and as a result it was difficult to find the entrance to the Air Canada business class lounge. The seating in the lounge was okay (we spent a couple of hours there) but the food and the Air Canada staff were poor at best.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,6.0,4,3,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,no
Air Canada,Having flow out of T2 twice on Eva Air recently this review covers both visits. Eva use the Air Canada lounge along with a couple of other Star Alliance carriers. It is close (2-3 minutes) to the boarding gates but suffers like some others on T2 in that it's a fair hike from immigration to the gates/lounge. One inside it is very modern and comfortable with a nice bar and service good range of food and good personal space. Travelling on a Wednesday evening there were not many people in the lounge and it felt quite and comfortable. A vast improvement on the old T3 lounge shared with SAS.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Air Canada,Worst lounge we have ever seen. Food buffet was almost empty and dirty and not filled up within hours. Washrooms very dirty. Noisy. Disappointing experience.,Toronto Pearson Airport,1.0,2,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
Air Canada,"Air Canada has made significant improvements in most of its lounges and they are obvious with the upgrade in service and food selection being noticeable. Gone are the days of dirty dishes and rude staff. It has been a welcome improvement. Unfortunately the YYZ MLL International lounge at the E gates seems to have been left behind. On the day I used it it was very busy with limited food offered and an unpleasant ambience. There are just too many people using the lounge many of whom have access because of their frequent flyer status. The end result is that pax who are flying on the expensive long haul flights in business class receive a mediocre experience. It's time for AC to divide the lounge into two sections one for the true international business class and ""Super Elite"" status pax and the other for the basic ""Elite"" pax and those flying on shorter route Rouge Premium. Provide a quiet area with better food for the first group and keep the current set up for the second group. My biggest wish is for AC to provide decent wifi access in its Canadian lounges. I have had better wifi access in ""developing"" world airports.",Toronto Pearson Airport,2.0,3,3,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,no
Air Canada,Now seated in lounge after a two week trip with time spent in other business class lounges Think Toronto maple leaf lounge is one of the worst we have visited Have visited this lounge often but prompted to finally share my thoughts with other travellers as the offering of a few salad items chilli Con carne and stale bread receives a failing grade Air Canada's food is consistently weaker than other competitors.,Toronto Pearson Airport,2.0,5,3,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no
Air Canada,Very comfortable and nicely decorated lounge with small but high quality food and drinks selection. Plenty of seating space and some proper tables and chairs to dine at rather than just sofas everywhere. Nice place.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Air Canada,This is the worst lounge. Bathrooms dirty and over flowing trash minimal lounge areas and NO BAR. They don't have a liquor license. All this at a time when the terminal at LAX is under renovation and offers minimal services. I can't believe a first class lounge could be so bad.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
Air Canada,I visit this Lounge six times a year in the pass few years. In my every visit the feelings are more or less the same in average except the food choices is very disappointing only cup cakes vegetables and cold boiled eggs. I have never encounter of any hot food nor hot soup in this lounge. Asian instant noodle is never seen here. My wife even prefer to sit outside in those paid cafe to have proper eating.,Toronto Pearson Airport,3.0,4,3,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,no
Air Canada,Worst lounge we have ever experienced poor service no food except crackers and cheese. Our flight was late and did not leave till 2:30 am the lounge closed at 11:30 pm. The seating was very uncomfortable bar only had very cheap wines that were free. Overall it was awful.,Honolulu Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
Air Canada,"I am always pretty pleased with the Air Canada Lounges (Vancouver is very good and so is Edmonton). Calgary has always been a large and crowded one. They have just done some renovations and while it looks much better (and the staff are invariably courteous and helpful) there is one down-side. There is no longer a self-serve bar. Been through there at least six times in the last month. When the Lounge is not too busy the bar is just fine (they will mix your drink or pour your wine) BUT when the Lounge is busy you end up standing along the bar with people several travellers deep... trying to get the bartender's attention. Once you have it it is very good - not sure if they are trying to control alcohol cost by not letting you ""help yourself"" but it certainly (only when the Lounge is busy as it often is) slows you down. I only had a 35 minute change of planes and could not get anything for the first 15minutes - waited at the bar got my wine drank half and had to leave. Again - it looks great but it is tougher if you are in a hurry. Staff still very courteous.",Calgary Airport,4.0,4,4,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Air Canada,After a very long walk from check in through security and then into T2B (this is the terminal adjacent to the new Terminal 2 at Heathrow where Air Canada has its arrival/departure operations) we finally arrived at the Lounge; access is by elevator (lift) from the departure terminal gates to an upper floor. We found way finding signage lacking in this brand new terminal and directions to Air Canada's ML Lounge were no exception. We were absolutely exhausted by this time and looking forward to settling in for lunch before our 3 p.m. flight to YUL. The Lounge was very large and of course brand new. Seating was plentiful and the menu selection was excellent with a complete self-serve bar. There was a chef preparing various cooked meals however we just helped ourselves to more lighter fare as we knew we would be having lunch/supper on the flight in a few hours. Washrooms were excellent with private toilets and showers. There was also a business centre which we did not use n or did we use WiFi as it was not secure. We would definitely access this lounge again now that we know where it is.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,yes
Air Canada,vMy spouse and I were flying to LHR via YUL on Premium Economy fares so we were able to purchase Maple Leaf (ML) access for the day of our travel. This is a relatively new Lounge in Winnipeg's James Richardson International Airport which opened a new terminal in 2011. The Lounge is easy to find near Gate 9. Staff were not particularly friendly and just verified our boarding passes without comment. We got seating window-side and helped ourselves to beverages and breakfast prior to our flight to YUL. All amenities and services were very good and seating is plentiful and comfortable.,Winnipeg Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,yes
Air Canada,After a long and frustrating process getting through customs and security after our flight from LHR we were looking forward to accessing the domestic terminal ML Lounge before our next two flights home. As usual it was a challenge finding the Lounge and the few Air Canada employees we talked to just grunted and pointed to another annex of the domestic terminal to its location - still not clear. We walked a considerable distance from our departure gate to somewhere near Gate 2 to access the Lounge. We were greeted by the same indifference from Lounge staff we experienced in our previous three ML Lounge visits in our trip to the UK; our boarding passes were scrutinized and handed back to us without comment. We walked into a somewhat small lounge with dated furniture passengers lounging about everywhere (this was about 6:30 p.m.) and almost every seat occupied. We finally found a couple of hard chairs in the walkway between the window seats and airline-style gate seats in th e back of the Lounge. We went to the self-serve food area only to find it barely stocked mostly with appetizers. Very disappointing. We were looking forward to proper meal as we knew we would not get any food service on our two upcoming flights through to YWG. The washrooms were dirty dated and in poor condition (broken panels towels all over the place). The overall condition of this Lounge appeared to be one of neglect or indifference. This would not make a very good impression on AC's frequent travellers or international business travellers. We finished up as soon as we could and left for our gate. We looked for a comment card but could not find one and Lounge staff were busy with other passengers. By this time there was almost just standing room.,Montréal Airport,2.0,2,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,no
Air Canada,After a very long walk from Gate 5 to Gate 52 we finally found the Maple Leaf Lounge in the International area of the YUL terminal. We found way finding signage in YUL to be barely adequate and that is being generous. This also held true for finding this Lounge. Staff were polite but not overly friendly; they just checked our boarding passes and handed them back without even making eye contact. We entered a large brightly lit lounge but could not find a window table; we had to settle for a table in the computer area. As we had a three-hour wait before departing for YUL we had a good lunch of soup sandwiches salads and beverages. Menu selection was varied. Seating was comfortable and washrooms were clean. WiFi is available but not secure. There was a good selection of newspapers and magazines. We would definitely access this lounge again.,Montréal Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,yes
Air Canada,EVA use the Air Canada Lounge in the new Terminal 2. A very nice airy new lounge at the new Terminal. It was very quiet when I was there 19;00-21:00 there was ample hot/cold food. the lounge is nice and bright/airy. |There is a bar tender which in itself is not a problem but sometimes there was a wait while they were out clearing tables or taking orders. All in all a vast improvement than the old lounge that was used in Terminal 3.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Air Canada,We visited the Air Canada transborder Lounge on the 14th of Sept. We were very pleased with the service and facilities offered. We had a long lay over and enjoyed both the breakfast and lunch offered. A variety of beverages were available. The lounge was very clean and roomy.,Vancouver Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Air Canada,BRU-YUL-SFO. We went out of our way to fly Air Canada back home from Europe. Had a 6-hour layover in Montreal which was nice. Easy access to the lounge staff speaks English and French (and possibly some other languages) quite fluently. Food in the lounge was not up to par (about 900 ml of cold pasta salad and some other similarly sized items were available for everybody). I went downstairs to the Burger King. Other than that however the internet is fast and functional there is a television and a wide selection of alcoholic beverages in an open-bar format. Not the best lounge but certainly not the worst.,Montréal Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Air Canada,I arrived at this lounge and it was hard to find a seat. the food was horrible. Empty hot meal trays just nacho chips salad and dips. Molsen beer tap was broken wine selection of one white and one red.,Vancouver Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Air Canada,The lounge of transhipment for flights to the United States. provides appropriate care. The Buffett is very good tasty including wide range of drinks. Wi Fi works and is fast. There are several workstation. The furniture is beautiful. In the room you stay comfortable all the time. A proper and respectful service with passengers. If you option Air Canada deserves to be prestigious.,Montréal Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Air Canada,The Maple Leaf Lounge in the International Section of Terminal 1 at Toronto's Pearson Airport is a pleasant lounge with lots of seating. The lounge has a good selection of drinks but the food selection is much less than what one gets in Europe or Asia. I was in the lounge in the evening (after 8:00pm) and they had noodles and a cold salad. They may have had soup as well. Cookies were available. The beverage supply is large and self serve. There are three Air Canada (Maple Leaf) Lounges at Toronto's Pearson Airport Terminal 1 one domestic one International and one for flights to the U.S. This review is for the international lounge which is used for Air Canada and Star Alliance members. In terms of layout and aesthetics this is a very pleasant lounge. It has a business area lots of seating showers and eating areas with big screen tvs. The newspaper and magazibne supply is huge The airport has free wifi; I'm not sure if the lounge has separate wifi. Most of the staff seem to be there to clean up rather than to help customers but the lounge is kept clean and front desk staff are fine. The view of the planes from this lounge is limited but it is a nice place to relax.,Toronto Pearson Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,yes
Air Canada,"Have visited this lounge in the ""rock wall"" in the domestic area several times over the past few years this visit in March 2014 I noticed that the food selection had improved. I was there at 8am on a Friday morning for 1.5 hrs and aside from the usual cold cereal hot oatmeal make your own toast small muffins/pastries and fruit there was a covered hot container with small omelets hash browns and large home fries. The coffee machines are wonderful offering mochas  lattes cappuccinos etc. Also hot chocolate. The serving dishes were kept filled and there was someone going around picking up used plates/cups etc frequently. The lounge seemed very clean as well as the women's washroom. The lounge is large and was about 1/4-1/3 full all the time I was there. Good selection of newspapers and lots of different magazines. Wifi seemed to work fine the little I used it. Great view of the continuous action out on the tarmac!",Vancouver Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Air Canada,I have a Priority Pass and on my way from CPT to BOS via LHR I had about 5 hours to kill. I thought I would use the lounge airside but after a 12 hour flight I wanted a shower and a light breakfast. This Air Canada Arrivals was heaven sent. It is just outside the arrivals hall to the left. Please watch out for signs because it is quite tricky to find. Once you are there the small but cosy lounge welcomes you with open arms. Good hot and cold food plus good coffee or tea a shower (very refreshing) and comfortable seats. Small if the place is crowded but at 8am it was very quiet.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Air Canada,My first experience of YYZ's T1 Domestic lounge got off to a bad start as the agent at the desk was engaged in a scintillating conversation with another agent regarding the closest gas stations to their homes. She never made eye contact offered any sort of welcome and simply handed back my boarding pass without so much as a thank you. Thanks Air Canada for making me feel like a valued customer! The lounge itself is attractive well groomed has ample seating and moderately appealing food choices. A far cry from the catering one would find in Star Alliance lounges in Europe or Asia but not bad by North American (United for example) standards.,Toronto Pearson Airport,3.0,4,5,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,yes
Air Canada,Wow a bad terminal in a horrible airport with a terrible lounge. Small poor food poor seating tiny and overall as far as international lounges a real disappointment. The Starbucks on main level is much better.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,2.0,2,2,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,no
Air Canada,The quality of internet access that the lounge offers is a joke. They expect Star Alliance Gold customers to pay $3.99 to use the internet because the free service they offer cannot even open basic websites. What's more embarrassing is that the free service offered by Vancouver airport is much faster and doesn't cripple your access to web services. Other Star Alliance members should return the favour for Air Canada visitors to their lounges. In a world where bandwidth has become as cheap as water it is ridiculous that Air Canada can get away with fleecing other Star Alliance customers.,Vancouver Airport,3.0,4,3,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,no
Air Canada,Arriving in Toronto at about 1.00pm we had a very long layover since the departure to CPH was at 21.05. The lounge was ok but the food choices and quality were very disappointing. Sort of dry boring sandwiches and three different warm dishes - all tasteless. If we should have waiting time at Toronto airport another day we rather pay for food in one of the eating places in the terminal than eating in the lounge. For a business class lounge of a 4 star airline the food is not adequate and compared to Scandinavian Airlines lounge in Copenhagen and Chicago it's poor. Even the TAP lounge at Lisbon airport has better food quality.,Toronto Pearson Airport,3.0,4,4,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,no
Air Canada,Nice lounge quiet and good internet  but needs to have dirty dishes picked up more often. Also their food offerings are poor. empty wine bottles and no staff to ask for assistance. Chips and hummus you need to scrape the bowl for. They need more staff and replace items more often. I still recommend it but if you need food go get it somewhere else first.,Ottawa Airport,3.0,5,2,3.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,yes
Air Canada,The lounge was physically fine but the snacks/food offerings were pathetic. A few applies and bananas sliced white bread for toast and pitchers of juice. I ended up with cereal and milk and thinking that there was great food for people flying coach right outside the doors. Also even with a sparsely populated lounge there was a line for the mens room because the mens room must apparently only cater to one person at a time.,Vancouver Airport,2.0,4,5,1.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,no
Air Canada,I was surprised by the selection of quality food and alcoholic beverages. Being US-based I was able to compare the many differences between the US airline lounges with the quality of Air Canada. Maple Leaf Lounges are definitely the benchmark for other North American Airlines.,Montréal Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Air Canada,"I used the lounge on 22nd December 2012 at around 8AM. The staff at the welcome desk worked very hard to solve a very tricky problem. Their knowledge and level of care was absolutely great. They solved a problem which could have ruined our long planned holiday. I was very impressed and thankful. If there would be a possibility to rate the level of ""Standard of Staff Service"" better then Excellent - I would do so. The Transborder Maple Leaf Lounge at Terminal 1 Toronto Airport was exceptional due to the superior staff.",Toronto Pearson Airport,3.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,5.0,yes
Air Canada,This is a great place to be 2 hours before your flight very quiet not around a lot of people. Many drink choices band a lot of food choices very comfortable and relaxing.,Montréal Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Air Canada,The lounge near the rock wall was the one I enjoyed the most. Wonderful selection of drinks food selection decent but only light foods. WiFi was excellent.,Vancouver Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,yes
Air Canada,Quiet peaceful and comfortable place to sit. Have never experienced it to be too busy. The decor is new and it is always kept clean. Food area has lots of space and selection is the best I have experienced of any North American airport. Despite all of the shortcomings of this airport the Maple Leaf Lounges here are by far the best experience.,Toronto Pearson Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Air Canada,Dirty no food selection crowded with no place to sit. Unappealing decor. Stayed 15 minutes and then left to sit in the public area.,Montréal Airport,1.0,1,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no
Air Canada,Nice looking large lounge with comfortable seating. Nice greeting on entering. Very good selection of drinks but food options limited and poor. Carrot and celery sticks and mountains of crackers. Only hot option was an unappealing soup and this was at dinner time.,Vancouver Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,no
Air Canada,We went to this lounge first thing in the morning because we had an early flight. The are supposed to open at 5:00 am and the door was still locked and the lights off when we arrived. We were let in about 10 minutes after and the girl was just putting things out. There really wasn't a big selection of food. There was tea coffee juice and she put out bread for toast terribly sweet muffins (in packages) and flavoured bagels none plain. There was also cereal. That was about it. I would not want to go there again. The lounge seemed old and in need of an update.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,3.0,3,4,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,no
Air Canada,Way too crowded! The place was packed at 4:30 and stayed that way when we left at 6:00. Two planes including ours had slight delays. The food selection was nice especially the Thai soup. Because it was so busy the cleaning staff had a lot of work and empty dishes sat for 20-30 minutes. There didn't seem to be a place for us to drop off our used plates. Good selection of magazines and newspapers.,Calgary Airport,4.0,4,3,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Air Canada,A very disappointing lounge which I have used several times for the past four years. Nothing much has changed in the period. Granted is a domestic terminal lounge but given the number of people who use it it is far too small. There are many international passengers who connect at YVR but there is not even a shower for people to freshen up after a 10+hr flight! There is no separate area for people who want to take a rest and because of the large number of people present it is very crowded and noisy-- not much different from the terminal building itself. Food is pretty average and always the same salad and soup options (but nothing vegetarian!).,Vancouver Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,no
Air Canada,Very spacious lounge with lots of comfortable seating and pleasant ambiance. Good selection of drinks snacks vegetables and dips. I've only used it in the evening when they also offer good pasta dishes and some salads. Staff is friendly. Only critique is that internet connection is often rather slow.,Toronto Pearson Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,yes
Air Canada,This lounge is big and well designed. Business centre with printing. Great selection of food snacks and drinks. Comfortable leather chair with foot rest in a mood room makes you a little too relaxed! I wish they had dedicated wifi for the lounge rather than using the general airport wifi which is fine but slow. Boarding announcements in a non intrusive way. For me this is the best AC lounge.,Toronto Pearson Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,yes
Air Canada,Excellent Lounge for North American standards. Drink selection very good food is usually rather light (salads and soups) but good. The weak point is the breakfast which is just cereals muffins and toast without any cheese ham or similar. They have an espresso / cappuccino machine producing excellent coffee. Free internet connection fast for Air Canada Elites usually works well unless the lounge is packed which can happen during peak hours.,Vancouver Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Air Canada,Very old school menu hasn't been updated in God knows how long. The dishwasher broke so plastic utensils styrofoam cups and plates were used instead. Despite there being 2 other lounges in the airport to bring equipment from. Air Canada service continues to crumble.,Toronto Pearson Airport,2.0,2,3,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,no
Air Canada,When YVR was a single terminal airport the Maple Leaf Lounges were larger; now there are three (domestic US/transborder international) and I was in the transborder lounge on this trip. Access up one floor in an elevator. Amenities are self serve but more generous and much tidier than Continental or United Airlines lounges. Comfortable seats and workstations. Limited snack buffet is well-attended to. Staff keeping things in order. Wifi the new system where some lounge users get (ostensibly) faster wifi access is silly. It was better when you could just boot up your machine tick the box and get on with things. Overall YYZ lounge is bigger. YYC is grottier. YHZ is tiny. YOW' is probably the nicest (but busiest). On balance I'll take ANY of the YVR lounges thanks.,Vancouver Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,no
Air Canada,I have used this lounge many times and love it. Spacious and modern with nice touches like original glass sculpture in the bathrooms and light but good food choices and self serve bar. A world apart from any US airline lounge I have been to where food means pre-packaged tasteless cookies and a pay bar.,Toronto Pearson Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,no
Air France,"This was a Priority pass lounge - not Air France! Comfortable enough but the food offerings here are as basic as you can get. A couple of ordinary sandwiches, some fruit and one type of a small maderia cake. The staff weren't in any rush to replenish either. Lazy lounge. Food and service.",Los Angeles Lax Airport,3.0,3,4,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,no
Air Canada,This lounge is a complete joke - cramped poor food selection beyond carrot sticks tomatoes soup and stale looking bread. Some breakfast snack items are ok. Can mix your own drink - oh joy. Coffee and cappuccino is fair. Looks dated and worn. Staff moderately helpful. Embarrassing (my home airport) when compared to other airports around the world.,Vancouver Airport,3.0,3,2,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
Air Canada,A disgrace there is no plausible reason to use this facility. The coffee is terrible food non-existent no showers apparently domestic has this for some reason and average business facilities. Staff at reception are friendly enough but that appears to be the limit of the hospitality. Wifi is now pointless as you can easily source it from many different services within the airport.,Vancouver Airport,2.0,3,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Air France,Spacious and quiet lounge with a wide range of quality food and alcohol including champagne. Enjoyable experience. Friendly staff.,Paris CDG Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Air France,Nobody at CDG airport seems to know where the AF arrival lounge is - they made my walk around for nearly one hour with plenty of luggage and I was unable to find. No signs anywhere.,Paris CDG Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Air France,One of the best lounges I have experienced. There are enough showers rooms. This is valuable as I usually come in this lounge before (or after) a 12-hour flight. I would have rated it 5* but the buffet especially drinks is a little bit skimpy.,Seoul Incheon Airport,4.0,5,5,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Air Canada,All Maple Leaf Lounges at Trudeau are appalling. Domestic is old and cold and needs a refit and the other lounges are a mess newspapers and used plates and wineglasses just left. I broke my rule and connected through Montreal yesterday. Considering the new Terminal One at Pearson is such a nice experience Montreal Trudeau is a disgrace.,Montréal Airport,2.0,1,1,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,no
Air Canada,The lounge is within the acceptable range variety of food were served but some of them were poor in taste. The shower facility was very limited only 2 showers were provided and passenger need to ask the lounge staff to unlock the shower door. WI-FI and high-speed internet connection were provided computers and business facility were also available. Chairs were comfortable and few of them were recliners. Overall speaking the lounge is still fair but not the best one I've been to.,Toronto Pearson Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,no
Air Canada,"The Maple Leaf lounge has been a very good ""office away from the office"" facility including free wifi a bowl of hot soup and the like. In a recent fit of penny-pinching Air Canada has started demanding that users purchase internet access using a credit card. It is not a huge sum - $10.00 - just enough annoy you especially when you know that you will have a fight with the accountants to claim it back. I sure hope that the pennies they accumulate from this change offset the costs associated with customer dissatisfaction.",Montréal Airport,2.0,3,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,no
Air France,It's worth noting that it very much depends on the terminal; typically if you are in 2E and 2F it's good level of lounge with showers fresh food coffee/ tea internet and power - all a business traveller wants. If you go to a lesser terminal 2D for example there really is nothing more than a seat coffee and power. It's worth noting that if you do have a long haul flight and you arrive before 2pm you can use the lounge in the arrivals area of 2C.. this has around 6 showers and the usual... not the most comfortable but the staff are polite and it's a hell of allot better waiting for your TGV (Train) in here after a shower.,Paris CDG Airport,2.0,3,3,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,no
Air France,This is a sorry excuse for a lounge. Drinks are plentiful but there was 1 sandwich when I walked in and an hour later still 1 sandwich. There were no plugs to recharge electronics and when I asked they directed me to unplug a lamp and use the socket! This is Air France's home country and this lounge is the best they've got? Quite sad as it is no better than a waiting room.,Paris CDG Airport,2.0,2,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
Air Canada,This place hasn't changed for years. Shower rooms are large and clean but had a really bad smell - like the sewer had backed up. The staff are welcoming but if I hadn't arrived so early and knew that my hotel room would not be ready I think I would just go straight to the hotel. Food offerings really limited in a small crowded room.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,4,4,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,no
Air Canada,One of the nicest lounges I've seen with great breakfast offerings and superb staff. And then there's the views!,Vancouver Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
Air Canada,I'm surprised at people complaining about food in Maple Leaf lounge. Air Canada provides comfort food (soup cookies bagels) free drinks internet access a great selection of newspapers and magazines. The lounge in Vancouver has a stunning view of the North Shore mountains - lounge in Edmonton has a fireplace - lounge in Ottawa is glass on 3 sides. Admittedly the domestic lounge in Toronto is often crowded with slow check-in. The international lounge there is soaring.,Vancouver Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no
Air France,We flew Aeromexico Business class from JFK to Mexico City On March 2014. Since the Aeromexico and Air France have a SkyTeam alliance agreement we went to Air France’s Business Lounge in Terminal 1 at JFK. The lounge is small and clean and does offer relaxation time before boarding. One can sit in a deep cushion chair place food on the table or use the complimentary computers. Food offerings on March 19 2014 started with stale roast beef/cheese sandwiches that came from the deep freeze cheap corn chips and packaged cookies one can find in a Supermarket etc. Champagne and other alcoholic and soft drinks were available in ample quantity. The coffee was good and so strong.,New York JFK Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,no
Air France,Noticed a small improvement in the food served here in this lounge I visit regularly. If you use this lounge after 7pm you might enjoy a light meal . Choices 10 days ago were a nice beef roulade salad and or grilled vegetables. Soup is also available usual cheese and cake for desert. Much better food then before in this lounge and more fun eating here then food served in airplanes at 1 am. Alcohol wines etc are excellent …If only Air France would see to it there would be some decent food all day long instead of having chocolate chip cookies from 1pm to 7pm this would be a further much appreciated improvement.,Paris CDG Airport,4.0,3,4,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,yes
Air France,Absolutely appalling. Dreadful food and tables covered with dirty plates and glasses that the non- existent staff have failed to remove. Quite the worst lounge I have ever been in.,Paris CDG Airport,2.0,2,1,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,no
Air Canada,Rather disappointed with the lack of breakfast choices when I used this lounge for an early morning flight. Bread butter muffin and a small bowl of fruit which emptied very quickly and took the attendants ages to top up. Coffee and tea only beverage choices with just 1 jug of orange on display. The Maple Leaf lounge had a rather' stingy' feel overall would not use it again.,Toronto Pearson Airport,2.0,3,3,2.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,no
Air Canada,Very pleasant lounge close to our departure gate. Food somewhat limited but my daughter enthused about the soup (only hot dish on offer). Seating comfortable and ranged from lounge chairs to dining with a good few recliners as well. Business services were excellent with swift internet access. Sadly only two showers for the whole of this busy lounge and you have to ask the reception staff to unlock them and then wait while they find a cleaner to re-stock and clear up after the last occupant!,Toronto Pearson Airport,3.0,4,4,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,no
Air Canada,This is one of the poorest lounges I have visited. The seats are worn food on offer consisted of a bowl of soup (in fairness very nice) and some cheese and very tired looking salad. There are no showers in this lounge which really surprised me. Not much of an advert for Air Canada at all. Staff were enthusiastic and pleasant.,Vancouver Airport,2.0,2,2,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,no
Air France,Had a five hour stopover between flights. No problems using this lounge for that length of time. Very spacious lounge with plenty of seating and tables for dining. Food provided was of the snack/light meal variety but was good quality. Champagne and wine available on a help your self basis. Toilet and shower facilities were excellent with really good shower lots of hot water at high pressure and good amenity pack provided. All in all an excellent oasis of calm in a very busy airport.,Paris CDG Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Air France,2 very small elevators as stairs to get to this lounge which is not that easy to find but i know my way around cog terminal 2e gate L OR K. Lounge is small surely for the crowd that makes usage of this lounge. Lounge is dark and not clean . it was early morning so food choice was poor choice as usual in cog airport  croissant  pain au chocolate cereals and something a new a chocolate that has no chocolate taste. Coffee and espresso machine seems to be in need of repair as what i received from this coffee maker had no coffee taste . For those wanting boost early in the morning everything available as soft drinks . As usual af lounge leaves me wondering why do I bother.,Paris CDG Airport,3.0,2,2,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,no
Air France,Dreadful. Avoid this lounge if you can. Looks like a temporary facility. Food was dreadful staff were invisible as were the facilities.,Shanghai Pudong Airport,2.0,2,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,no
Air Canada,Buried in the basement of CDG this lounge gets extremely crowded at times. Two flights a day to Canada and if one is delayed then it is sitting room on the floor only. Food not bad croissants cheeses yogurts etc. for breakfast and some sandwiches later on in the day plus the usual array of drinks. The lone staff person was excellent although it is ridiculous that those of us with connections that we are going to miss because of delays cannot be rebooked onto another flight. We have to wait till we get to Canada to be rebooked making everyone very cranky.,Paris CDG Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,3.0,0.0,5.0,4.0,no
Air Canada,Limited view of the apron. Newspaper/food/drink selections minimal. Good business facilities. Toilet facility inadequate and was not kept clean.,Toronto Pearson Airport,2.0,4,3,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,no
Air Canada,This small lounge is also used by Air France at times and quickly becomes overcrowded. The rest of Terminal 2 at LAX is even more congested. Public washrooms are located outside the lounge but are well-maintained. Good selection of self-serve beverages but food is limited to cheese and crackers. Large west-facing windows provide nice views but only two have pull-down shades. As a result the lounge becomes too hot. Tattered furniture needs replacing.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
Air France,La Premiere Lounge at CDG is probably the best airport lounge I have experienced. Limo transfer direct from disembarkation gate on arrival from long haul flight. Air France staff accompanies to the dedicated security lane inbound to lounge. In the lounge enjoy the Alain Ducasse restaurant some exceptional wine. Beautifully restful chaise longue area with subdued lighting for resting. Toilets and showers are a work of art. Nice bathrobes and slippers with top of the range cosmetics/shower products. Agent drives you to the steps of your departing plane for the next sector.,Paris CDG Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Air France,Crowded and hard to find a place to sit. Washrooms dirty and small for size of lounge. Food service non existent but decent choice of soft drinks available. Overall not impressive and rather poor offering from a reputable air carrier.,Paris CDG Airport,1.0,1,1,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,no
Air Canada,Very nice small lounge at Heathrow. Good continental breakfast available excellent showers and 2 computers. What makes this lounge special is the excellent staff friendly and helpful. Every time I use this lounge is it very empty could be because it is located outside the terminal a short walk from the arrivals area.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Air Canada,The Toronto Pearson lounge was not very good food wise. I guess they assume everyone would prefer to drink then eat. If you like alcohol then this is the place for you if you don't then take snacks with you.,Toronto Pearson Airport,3.0,4,4,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,no
Air Canada,This lounge was recently opened and is quite nice and very bright inside. It has almost 360 Degree windows which allow light in. As with most Maple Leaf lounges the food is almost non existent. I was there between 8-10AM and there was only some bread for toasting and some yogurt and granola. The business center was good with several computers connected to the internet and several places to dock personal computers. Overall I would say this lounge is much better than the old one.,Ottawa Airport,4.0,4,4,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Air France,Very poor facilities old lounge what are they doing? Very poor services friendliness cleanliness etc.,Paris CDG Airport,2.0,2,2,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,no
Air France,I took the opportunity to test the new AF lounge at the newest boarding satellite called S4. A completely new experience from the other lounges I have visited at CDG. Very large seperated in several areas with a real bar with the usual selection and great wines and a first for any AF lounge a self service Hot food corner including some risotto pasta cold meat and some pastries for dessert. A huge step from the S3 lounge. No problem at all to find a table or a sofa to rest. Plenty of working space and reading material too. Modern design with a nice view on the tarmac. Hope they would upgrade the other lounges the same way!,Paris CDG Airport,4.0,5,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Air France,Kind of a fail. This lounge is dated worn and desperately needs air conditioning. The leather chairs are worn and dirty. The wi-fi is slower than the general free Frankfurt Airport wi-fi and just outside the lounge is a long hallway with recliners for regular passengers to lounge in comfort. The only places to sit in the lounge for lounge customers are upright chairs. Additionally there are no bathrooms within the lounge and if you need those facilities you are directed to leave the lounge and go down the hall to use public bathrooms. Given all of this I'm not really sure why you would choose to come in to this lounge unless you would like to eat some of the simple packaged cookies or the cheese that is sitting out in warm temperatures. Very little in the way of hard liquor. No red wine on display and a single white wine in the refrigerator. There was a sparkling wine in an ice bucket that was untouched. I found this whole wine selection to be odd. Air France needs to spend a little effort at improving this lounge in my opinion.,Frankfurt Main Airport,2.0,2,3,2.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,no
Air France,Lounge is easy to find and close to gate but lounge is still the same lounge as I have visited to many times when flying from this airport. Not so comfortable chairs that are already showing there usage. Cheap South African wine and some sandwiches chips crackers and some cheese. Not really a place to enjoy relax after working all day and still having to fly 10 hours. Wifi improved and is working very well now.,Johannesburg Airport,4.0,3,4,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,no
Air France,A few seats uncomfortable. No decent food coffee and tea from coin machines. Some newspapers. Such a minimal lounge that I now avoid it and use the open bars and cafes of the airport far better and friendlier.,Lyon Airport,2.0,2,4,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,no
Air France,Old and crowded lounge always full. They have 3 flights (2 AF and one KLM) departing early evening so the space is not enough for all passengers. The food is mediocre and there is only one old shower in urgent need of renovation.,Rio De Janeiro Airport,3.0,4,3,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,no
Air France,We used the business class lounge of Charles de Gaulle as transit passengers. The experience was horrible. Dirty seats empty bags and paper glasses no choice in food just some packaged stuff. Plus the lounge was crowded. On the way back the lounge was almost empty but the manager decided to prevent us from getting in with 10 and 12 yrs old children (who were on economy class tickets). All in all my experience with Air France is way below average.,Paris CDG Airport,2.0,2,1,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,no
Air France,The lounge is okay and I get to do my work without interruptions or noise. However in the morning and there is no food - just snacks I thought by now with all the complaints something would be different.

Air France,A charming stewardess picks you up at the incoming flight taking you to this dedicated Lounge. A butler welcoming you a Michelin starred restaurant with perfect service and outstanding wines. The quality of showers massage is like a hotel. All passport formalities completed in the lounge.,Paris CDG Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Air France,One of the worst I have been in. It is very small and has the most uncomfortable chairs. Before international flights in the evening it is packed. People walking around trying to find a seat. The bathrooms are small and dirty. Food selection is minimal. Plenty of cold drinks. Do not pay extra to get into this lounge.,Johannesburg Airport,2.0,1,3,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Air France,"Absolutely diabolical. The food selection is virtually non-existent unless you like potato As a regular JNB passenger I visit this lunge often. The worst part are the most uncomfortable seats - the seat are designed to make a ""statement"" but are the most uncomfortable ever experienced among many business lounges around the world. Air France should look at their KLM partner lounges in AMS and its seat / electric outlet convenience (still no international plugs - they require adapters). Food and beverage selection is decent and so is the internet functionality. Men's bathroom typically dirty sometime lacking supplies.",Johannesburg Airport,3.0,2,2,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,no
Air France,Absolutely diabolical. The food selection is virtually non-existent unless you like potato crisps/chips. What food there is (cold slabs of processed pork a bowl of mini-gherkins and some awful sandwiches) is desperately low quality. There is no service within the lounge itself which is sterile and uncomfortable. In AF's home country at their home airport this is a disgrace.,Paris CDG Airport,2.0,2,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no
Air France,Pretty awful. Food is very poor and coffee is truly dreadful. Decor is ugly fittings are falling off the walls staff are invisible (debris stays at tables for hours).,Paris CDG Airport,2.0,3,3,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,no
Air France,It seems that most lounges from Air France I visit suffer from the same acute problem. Food quality and choice is ridiculous compared with lounges from other airlines. AF lounge in Paris terminal 2E food choice is very poor and cheap quality. Most food there is cheap sandwiches crackers and chips. Choice of drinks is ok even if wine quality could be better to even much better.,Paris CDG Airport,3.0,3,3,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no
Air France,The lounge in 2F at CDG is a shame as the terminal 2F itself. In the entrance the welcome speech from the staff is almost an apology about the lounge situation. One floor was closed so the remaining space was totally crowded. The only seats we could find were at a table in the end facing bathrooms. Very limited food choice only cold croissants and nuts crisps. There were only one shower 40 minutes wait time.,Paris CDG Airport,3.0,2,1,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,no
Air France,The design is very trendy and it offers nice views on the apron. It is divided in several zones depending on what you are looking for. Usually AF lounges are not very good for the catering but this one offers a wide choice of food and drinks. I took advantage of the Clarins Spa that is free. It's now time for Air France to offer a consistent product and offer the same comfort and quality and choice of food in all their lounges.,Paris CDG Airport,5.0,5,4,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Air France,I don't understand the Air France business class product at all particularly compared to similarly priced business class products like British Airways or Virgin Atlantic (which actually are less expensive). At a BA or Virgin lounge you get a fully stocked and staffed bar. At Air France the self- service selections at Air France are limited. At a BAR or Virgin Lounge I can order a full sit down meal. At Air France I got to chose from slices of cold pork some cheese some crackers and potato chips. I do my best to avoid Air France but sometimes I have no other option.,Paris CDG Airport,3.0,4,5,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,no
Air France,Flew with Icelandair who use this new Air France lounge. Staff in lounge very friendly food was sandwiches and nuts. Food well presented bar staffed at all times this I thought was not good as I like to get my own drinks. Showers great and very refreshing water hot and shower room was well cleaned. If I had one complaint I would say the seating looks like old school chairs. Great views from the big windows of the aircraft coming and going. I also imagine that with a A380 the lounge would be cramped and very busy - Lucky only 2 B777's on my departure day.,Washington Dulles Airport,4.0,3,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes

Air France,Dirty tables uncleared for hours - looks like 3rd class train waiting room. Go to a restaurant instead.,Orlando Airport,2.0,3,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
Air France,The lounge was airy with good food. Plenty of quality wines. The wi-fi connection was efficient. Toilets were clean. The lounge is close to the boarding gate. This made for a pleasurable experience.,Boston Logan Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes
Air France,This lounge is small but quiet most of the time. The front desk assistant was friendly and made sure to make announcements about flights which were boarding. The snacks are fresh and delicious. The bar selection was not extensive but there is a reason for this - If you want a drink such as champagne or a caipirinha just ask! The restrooms were small but clean. There was constant removal of empty plates glasses etc. The internet was very slow during the peak hours but at other times the internet speed was fair.,Sao Paulo Guarulhos Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,yes
Air France,Lounge is used by many airlines too many for the size of the lounge even if I got lucky this time and found a good seat. The lounge is used by so many airlines that announcements for flight boarding are going on forever - maybe they should learn from other lounges and make this one a silent one. Food quality is poor and choice is at the same disappointing level. Drinks consist of cans and bottles that are presented in a very small refrigerator - meaning the cans have no time to become col. Wine served is local brew. Lets hope for a Skyteam lounge in new terminal. Wifi is very badly organised and only 3 computers available.,Mumbai Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,no
Air France,Same old overcrowded lounge with same food and drinks (choice not very big or interesting) espresso machines are dirty and food is tasteless. Lounge is also used by people having a certain credit card. While waiting to get in and present your invitation one has to wait for the man in front of you deciding if he is going to charge his credit card with money or points.,Tel Aviv Airport,2.0,3,1,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
Air France,Too small both the AF and KLM flights leave within a few minutes it is far too crowded. No power outlets seating not very comfortable lounge looks a bit worn. Drink selection just ok food not what you would expect of the French!,Hong Kong Airport,2.0,2,3,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,no
Air France,This is without doubt the worst lounge as far as food is concerned. A 11pm flight and nothing to eat but crisps and dry cheese. Air France should be ashamed.,Paris CDG Airport,3.0,4,4,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,no
Air France,A perfectly adequate lounge a bit small. Not as nice as the bigger 2E lounge but nice. Staff very friendly. Food fine - sandwiches yoghurt soup crisps and drinks. I enjoy the Air France lounges.,Paris CDG Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no
Air France,A good lounge with direct access to gate M7 usually the one used by the AF departure. Great supply of French newspapers adequate Wifi snacks/sandwiches usually OK Champagne very good (but has a tendency to run out quickly and staff less than enthusiastic about bringing new bottle).,Chicago O'Hare Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
Air France,Terrible Lounge - no water in the toilets neither for washing hands. I used the only 50CL bottle at around 19.00 hrs. Was sitting close to the toilet entrance and observed that none of the lounge staff put a new bottle of water - during 3 hours (time of boarding). In the meantime people were walking in/out and of course did their thing without washing hands!,Lagos Airport,2.0,2,2,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no
Air France,Malaysia Airlines use this lounge -small and shabby with uncomfortable seating. The choice of food and drinks was very poor. The staff were rather indifferent and off hand when we asked for more croissants. They were having a delivery of stock which was being wheeled through the lounge during the whole of the one and half hours we were there not a very relaxing atmosphere! There is no left luggage facility so if you want to shop you have to take you hand luggage with you. For a European Airport the standard of this lounge is shocking.,Paris CDG Airport,1.0,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no
Air France,Lounge is really average and comparable to other AF lounges in CDG. The letdown is the poor quality of the food offered. It was lunch time we were provided with a meagre choice of soup sandwiches a slice of turkey and cheese. Needless to say every one rushed for food there was nothing left besides the usual chips and crackers. The lounge is big let down as 2E is the modern part of CDG.,Paris CDG Airport,3.0,3,4,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no
Air France,Arriving at 1830 the upper level was very full and everywhere you looked there were trays with empty cans wrappers napkins etc. Catering not that bad. An assortment of grilled sandwiches soup crisps bread cheese nuts etc. Staff manning the desks were a bit sullen. I hope that their other lounges at CDG are of better quality.,Paris CDG Airport,3.0,3,2,4.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,no
Air France,The lounge in 2F at CDG is small and very crowded. The only seats we could find were at a table in the cafe area at the back. The whole place feels more like a railway station waiting room than a business class lounge. Limited food choice some sandwiches nuts crisps etc. Are all AF lounges at CDG as abysmal as this?,Paris CDG Airport,2.0,2,2,3.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,no
Air France,Air France business lounges in Terminal 2C and 2F are very similar. Upper Deck Closes at 1630 adding to overcrowding of the small main lounge which at peak times is horrible overcrowded loud and noisy. Selection of drinks is limited sometimes there are some snacks (cheese baguettes fruits etc) which disappear within a few minutes because of the big amount of guests. Rest rooms are too small and Staff do not seem to be very motivated or even attempt to pretend they care! The feedback unit did not work which says it all.,Paris CDG Airport,2.0,2,3,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,no
Air France,Le Patiolounge is located on the 1st floor of Orly-Ouest Hall 2 just after the security check. Staff is very polite and friendly. Lounge is clean and seats are comfortable with a nice view on the apron. There are three free internet computers - all were working properly. Quite a large selection of newspapers but most of them in French and only two in English. The huge disappointment is the poor food and drinks. For hot drinks there are only vending machines - the same type as in gas stations. The choice for cold beverages is a bit larger but only small cans are offered. Forget about food - at any time of the day the lounge offers only chips or biscuits!,Paris Orly Airport,2.0,3,3,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,no
Air France,"The staff are reasonably polite but that's where the positives end. We were both starving when we got to the lounge at 6pm but there was no hot food. I then decided to have some cold food but there was hardly any of that either! What is the use of crackers without cheese or butter? Only Air France knows the answer to that. All they had was crisps. On complaining to the staff I was told since ""a few months ago"" they only serve food at certain times. When they did eventually serve the much awaited fare it was tepid soup and that was about it.",Paris CDG Airport,3.0,3,3,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,no
Air France,Basic lounge upstairs of the main alley in the terminal. No view except over the shopping corridor below. Limited range of food except crisps biscuits. Even during lunch hours disappointing. Drink range adequate so is the reading material. Couple of pc with free internet access good but faulty connection. Toilets are outside the lounge.,Zurich Airport,2.0,3,3,3.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,no
Air France,Very modern looking retro lounge. It has several work stations and free wifi. Several staff had occupied one corner and were trying to hide while being noisy and consuming lounge food and beverages. Food included crisps fruit pies quiches sandwiches. There was a self service bar with wines beers soft drinks coffees sparkling wine and spirits. Good choice. Not too much reading material.,Johannesburg Airport,3.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no
Air France,"Not a good experience Despite Pudong having a lot of lounges passengers from several flights seem to be packed into just 1 so that the staff end up trying to find seats for guests. The welcome was poor along the lines of ""voucher sit down"". Food poor no white wine only red and a request for white was met with a simply ""no"". In the end we moved out To the main concourse as it is quieter more pleasant and far less crowded. What is the point of paying extra for this?",Shanghai Pudong Airport,1.0,2,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no
Air France,"I wonder if we are talking about the same lounge here. There are two international terminals one for Saudi Arabian airlines and one for all other airlines. At the ""foreign"" international terminal the lounge was crowded and obviously too small but let's say it did the job: a seat free drinks free Wi-fi. Women can access the lounge and sit anywhere (it is not separate). There are large TV screens and staff announce flights on time.",Riyadh Airport,2.0,2,3,3.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,no
Air France,The lounge is pretty basic. Small not particularly well kept. Chairs are worn and electric outlets were not adapted to American plugs. The highlight of the lounge is the older man who works there who showed me how to pour my sweet Vermouth properly (over ice). Lounge has a decent supply of newspapers.,Rome Ciampino Airport,2.0,2,2,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,no
Air France,Good selection of food and drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic however the seats are the most uncomfortable I have even seen. This is definitely not a lounge you would want to spend a lot of time waiting for a flight! Their old lounge was far more comfortable. Air France need to look into making this more comfortable for passengers especially in this age when increasing security issues make longer stays at the airport more and more common.,Mumbai Airport,3.0,1,4,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,no

American Airlines,One of the nicest lounges I have visited. The seating is excellent and plenty of room to find your own quiet space. The food and beverage selection is excellent.

American Airlines,"Flagship Lounge at LAX was good. Showers clean and well-stocked. They also had a nice little 4th of July spread with cake, special red, white and blue beverages. As for lunch, chicken barbecue, mixed vegetables including corn on the cob was served. Quality was poor and the chicken was very dry. Beverage selection was not as extensive as the Flagship Lounge at JFK. Lounge itself was spacious with excellent views of the apron. Overall, a decent flagship lounge, somewhat comparable to their Flagship Lounge at JFK although catering still needs improvement.",Los Angeles Lax Airport,8.0,4,5,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes

American Airlines,"Concourse B Admirals Club at JFK was great. Plenty of open seating, great views of the tarmac and not crowded at all. Bathrooms were well stocked and clean. Service was excellent and personable. Like most US lounges, complimentary food is poor, but  it's a space where you can work, relax and be away from the main crowd. I also tried the Concourse C lounge which was smaller but cozier. Lounge in Boston was much better in my opinion. Great views, better service and showers were lovely. It was spacious, filled with amenities. I decided to buy one of the items on their menu, the Lobster Mac and Cheese, and it was perfect. It was fresh and delicious, well worth the 9 bucks. Overall, both locations were excellent. Understand that the complimentary food is abysmal but it's a great place to relax and unwind.

Shabby old interior badly in need of a refresh unappetizing food choices of sad looking sandwich meats cheeses vegetables et all presented in old school trays/tins. Old school tech as well with half the power ports not functional. Not even remotely close to QF CX BA standard and BA should be ashamed to use it.

American Airlines,I fly from JFK 2-3 times a year using the AA business lounge. It is overcrowded noisy and unpleasant. The 2 drink vouchers are tacky. In other European or South American airports you have self service alcohol displayed wine liquor soft drinks etc. At CDG in Paris the business lounge has fabulous capuccino and espresso machines with fresh orange juice and fresh pastry. In Vienna cooked food for lunch with pastry also self service. No charge for food or drinks. Too bad that the AA lounge is pitiful in comparison. For the prices they charge it is mistifying how bad the quality and service are. it has been always bad but worst since the merger.,New York JFK Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,no
American Airlines,I cannot believe that AA view this sort of service as First Class. It is one of the worst lounges I have ever visited in terms of service. It is basically a reasonably comfortable waiting area with minimal facilities for the customers who have paid high fares.

American Airlines,Used the lounge at terminal 8 near gate 14. I knew the food offering was going to be poor so bought a sandwich from the food court and took it with me to the lounge. I was offered two drink vouchers but only used one for a pint. A waiter was available to take your drink and paid for food orders which saved you going to the bar. The free food offering was as expected very poor a few carrot sticks etc and cookies. There was some fresh brew coffee and make your own coffee from a machine which I tried and wasn't bad. As I was transmitting I decided to take a shower the shower room was functional but hardly inspiring but did the job.

American Airlines,"My wife and were taking the daytime 09.05 Chicago to London Heathrow AA90 flight. We arrived at the airport at about 06.00 (without having any breakfast at our hotel) and checked-in without problems. We passed through security and after a long walk found our way to the Admiral's Club lounge. What a disappointment the lounge turned out to be - American Airlines clearly has much to learn from British Airways on how to run a decent lounge. There was no food available that I could see (with the exception of a few bagels very small muffins and some pretzels) unless you paid for it. Furthermore there were no plates available - my wife had to ask for one and had to wait for almost ten minutes before it arrived. Just what does American Airlines think their business and first class passengers are paying thousand of pounds/dollars for? This practice of making passengers pay for food in the lounge is just cheap On entry to the lounge we were each given two vouchers for free bar drinks (how many people want bar drinks at that time in the morning?) from ""the pit"" - not high quality brands of alcohol. The lounge seats were comfortable enough but there were far too many dirty glasses and plates left on tables waiting to be collected and taken away. All in all our Chicago O'Hare Admiral's Club experience was very disappointing indeed. the service we received on our eight-hour flight to the UK was also very poor and the inflight food was absolutely terrible.

Falls short of most top tier European or Asian airlines business offerings much less first class. Decent range of drinks but nothing special in terms of quality wines spirits. Basic food options one hot one cold plus snacks cheese. Good views across to Manhattan. Small and a bit cramped though chair arms worn through to the stuffing seating close spaced so no privacy.

American Airlines,Came in here in transit to Mexico after AA flight from London. Reasonably comfortable place with good views over airport. What seems somewhat mean and petty is that on checking in to the lounge you are given a voucher for just one alcoholic beverage. From a European perspective this is strange - especially since at AA Admirals Lounge in Heathrow there's an open bar. Most customers in this situation in my experience do not come into these lounges to drink the bar dry - but the option of a second drink without paying more would be nice - especially after buying an expensive business class ticket. On my way back to London through DFW used the smaller British Airways lounge and they have no one drink voucher policy. It's a pity AA do this - as their service from LHR to DFW is a great business class product in the air in the new 777 ER - probably best transatlantic.,Unknown,4.0,5,5,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes

American Airlines,"Thankfully on my return flight home that had a long layover at JFK I was able to use the AA lounge instead of the horrid BA lounge. There are actually 2 AA lounges in the same terminal one is on the top floor. I utilized both because the gate for my flight changed and they offered me the opportunity to go to the lounge closer to the gate. Both of these lounges are good and you can choose which one you use. Really it depends on what you're after. The one on the top floor gave me great personal service when I arrived and when they noted the length of my last flight they offered me use of the shower. I didn't have to wait they had plenty available. This lounge had self serve bar with a decent (though not extensive) amount of options or you could use drink coupons at their attended bar to order cocktails. The attended bar was a little lonely looking and didn't look well stocked but I'm not positive. The lower level lounge also had great customer service the front desk person greeted me nicely and assisted me with updates about my delayed flight changed my seats etc. They didn't seem to have a self-service bar but the attended bar over here was lively and had a very sweet older bartender who called every customer ""mi amor"". She was so sweet. When my plane unexpectedly began to board after many delays she quickly got me a drink so I'd have time to finish it and she got me bottles of water to take on the plane. Computers were set up next to the bar area and had high top chairs making it comfortable to have a drink while checking your email. I don't think this lounge had showers but since I'd already showered at the first lounge I didn't go looking for it either. Only gripe was that despite it being around dinner time they didn't have food options except a few limited things to purchase.

If you're looking for a quiet place to work this might be a good place though you can find similar places for free throughout the rest of the terminals. If you're looking for food or drinks the AC has possibly the worst food I've had in an airport - and you have to pay for the privilege. Whoever runs these places would do well to visit any of their competitors lounges it would take less than 10 minutes to see how far short they fall. I travel a lot and was reasonably excited to get be able to use the AC regularly - at this point I now avoid flying American when I can so that I can get status into one of the other lounges - AA doesn't make anything about being elite worthwhile other than getting on first.,Unknown,2.0,3,4,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no

American Airlines,I really struggled to find the lounge in the first place. Then I realised why - they are just to embarrassed by the service they offer to publicise it. 1 free alcoholic beverage which only - really and you do that by the humiliation of handing me a 'free drink voucher'? Is this really the executive lounge. Is this really what you get if you pay $5000+ for an international flight. Still I'm sure the wonderful free food will be great won't it - hang on you have to buy the food as well - really are you kidding me? I have a long haul flight where I want to sleep and not eat so eating beforehand is what I always do I have never had to pay for food in any executive lounge before.

American Airlines,Purchased a day pass to use at DFW/ORD/LAX. This review is for the lounge at ORD only. Lounge amenities lacking. The only self-serve beverages are coffee/tea/water. Free food consists of supermarket type cookies and two choices of apples. The latter are acceptable due to the fact that AA flights in Business/First more than make up for this with food/beverage/alcohol service. What was especially appalling about this lounge is the restroom/toilet facilities. AA terminal restrooms are usually crowded and dirty so I though that the lounge restrooms would be clean and inviting: quite the opposite! To start there are not private stalls like the lounges at DFW/LAX. I was carrying multiple carryon bags and tried to find a stall which would accommodate them. The stall closest to the wall was occupied the next one over had a broken lock the next one over was missing the hook in which to hang bags/coats and the handicapped stall had an almost one inch gap between the door and where it is supposed to lock. The lock maybe jutted out 1/16 of an inch and opened several times when I tried to hang my bag on the door hook. Making things worse there seemed to be no air conditioning in the restroom and a male employee kept pacing the area in front of the stalls with a bag of toilet paper rolls loudly conversing on the phone in a foreign language. All of the above factors made me leave the restroom and lounge early (sweating bullets by this point) for the family restroom outside of gate H6. Not worth the money paid and I would not pay the annual membership fees for such discomfort/lack of amenities.,Chicago O'Hare Airport,2.0,3,4,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,no

The lounge staff were outstanding on a very difficult and long work day. My lounge access came as a BA Executive Club Gold member (One World Emerald). Unlike the AA Admiral's Club lounges their Flagship Lounges provide complimentary food and alcoholic beverages.

American Airlines,I fly a lot with Oneworld and have used the lounges of BA / CX / QF and others extensively. AA's Admirals club is clearly not in the same league. At first I thought that the economics of the huge domestic US market with its relatively low fares compared to Int'l long-haul might be the explanation.

Compared to other airlines in Europe Australasia and the Middle East this is shabby. The lounge itself is pleasant if overcrowded. Seating when you can get any is very comfortable and many visitors were enjoying the US Open Tennis on several large screens.

Although the club is very roomy plenty of seats wifi coffee / tea and minimal snacks you have to pay for everything. Staff at the front desk accommodating everything after that very disappointing. The club is located in the centre of the terminal thus away from most of the gates that I'm assigned so it is also inconvenient. I don't even bother going into the club any more.

American Airlines,The Admirals Club is not really a first class lounge. It's only offered to first class passengers if you're traveling overseas. I was traveling first class Toronto to Chicago to San Jose - and they wouldn't let me enter. Out of curiosity I bought a 24 hour pass for $50 to see what was so special about this lounge. One would expect an airlines flagship lounge service to be very nice. The Admiral Lounge only offers crackers and cookies and there is no self-service bar. If you want anything more you have to pay for it. The bar is tended and they only offer cheap drinks and poor quality wine and beer. You have to pay for anything that actually tastes good. From the outside the doors leading to the lounges looks like heaven awaits on the other side. Don't be fooled. Amongst other things the staff is too preoccupied with their own personal concerns talking amongst themselves - usually about some negative aspect of their job.

American Airlines,Sadly we were very disappointed with AA's Admirals Club lounge at Heathrow. The lighting (harsh neon striplights which cast a stark glare over the whole lounge reminiscent of a public lavatory) was horrible and as we had left home at a very early hour in the morning we were looking forward to a good breakfast like BA provide in their lounges. We found only pretzels and packaged biscuits available until some dry rolls containing awful tasting bacon were produced hours after we arrived and had checked in. Even the coffee was grotty and we didn't fancy alcohol at 7am. We were not impressed and our later experiences with Admiral's Club lounges at San Juan and Chicago were even worse.

American Airlines,"I decided to purchase a day pass to the lounge in Miami International on the way to Paris. I'd avoided it in the past because it was always a bit of a hike from the gate but I wanted to get some work done before my flight. My first clue that I'd made a mistake was when the agent at baggage check-in upon seeing that I'd purchased the day pass told me I was crazy for having done so. And she was right. It took nearly 15 minutes of standing at the counter in the Club to get my WiFi password and free drink voucher processed. That was disheartening but not as much as using the free drink voucher for a glass of champagne and being handed a twist off mini-bottle of sparkling wine. As you might expect it tasted terrible. The ""free nibbles"" that were provided were scarce and stale. And unlike at CDG nobody came to get me to tell my that my flight was boarding. There wasn't a single announcement made. So with 25 minutes to go before my flight I made the hike back to the gate and found that everyone had already boarded.

American Airlines,"This is the first time I have travelled Business class with AA so after a great experience in the lounge at Heathrow I was expecting great things when departing from Dallas. But oh how wrong I was. Firstly I was directed to the wrong lounge by the pleasant lady at check in. She sent me to the BA lounge. Anyway once I found the Admirals Club I was greeted by the most miserable man on the planet. ""do you want wireless?"" I was asked to which I was presented with a plastic card with a scratch off back. I was also presented with a ""good for one complimentary beverage"" voucher! One drink? For the amount I paid for this ticket I would expect more than one free drink. I have never seen that in a Business Class lounge before. Anyway feeling hungry I looked through the menu and decided on a panini. $9.99. No please Hello Or thank you from the man behind the bar just a ""sign here"". ( he didn't even take my voucher so I guess I may get another free drink after all). Food arrived fast as the bar staff cook it themselves. It's a bit like starbucks!! But it took someone an hour to clear the empty plate from my table. Taste wise? I should have eaten outside the lounge. Absolute rubbish food. Bought a second beer. Cost me $6 dollars. To be honest it's a bit like sitting in a pub chain not a Business Class lounge. I think I may stick to BA next time although this is a shared flight. Forget the wifi. It takes ages to type in a 14 digit code. Do what others do AA. This is not Business Class as I know it. I'm very disappointed.",Unknown,2.0,1,1,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,no
American Airlines,The amenities are nice well laid-out and may have been recently renovated. However when it comes to food this lounge falls flat on its face. As others have said they have apples a pretzel mix and some cookies for free. Also it does appear there is a coffee machine of sorts which is free. There is a list of free alcoholic beverages (cocktails beer and wine) on the posted menu at the bar. The bar attendant made no effort to interact any more than the minimum and handles all food money buttons etc. without consideration for sanitation.,Unknown,4.0,5,4,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no
American Airlines,It was the most over rated Lounge I have visited - not even up to a basic acceptable standard.

American Airlines,This is the new first class Flagship Lounge recently opened - the previous one was a bit small but did have a nice clubby feel about it as did the Admirals Club. These new clubs have more of a hospital waiting room atmosphere about them - Flagship lounge is slightly better but not by much. Obviously the same design theme (hospital waiting room) was chosen by the designer. Slightly better selection of snacks and drinks than the Admirals but compared to BA Cathay etc it falls short.

American Airlines,I have about 2million miles on American and transit through London a lot. I suffered though the interminable renovation at the Admirals Club at LHR and what a massive disappointment it is. It has all the charm of a bus terminal or hospital waiting area. Overly bright the seating is all out in the open so the sense is of an uninviting space that seems designed to set you on edge rather than relax you. The food offering is dreadful - little plastic wrapped awful cakes cheap wine and reconstituted juices. The staff are rude and officious. One only has to compare this with the BA lounges in Terminal 5 to see where they have gone wrong at every turn. This and the fact that they have now substituted the slow cramped 757 for wider bodied planes on a lot of the London flights just screams this is an airline who couldn't care less about its customers even those who are its premium ones.,London Heathrow Airport,2.0,1,3,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,no
American Airlines,This is the most sterile boring uncomfortable lounge I have ever been in. Who ever designed this monstrosity should be forced to spend some time there.

American Airlines,"This is the new AA lounge at LHR - recently refurbished and what a disappointment. Like a hospital waiting room from a bad TV set. Uncomfortable seating in a horribly lit open area - florescent lighting is harsh - AA got it 100% wrong with this remodelling. This lounge holds at least 100 people and the mens room has 2 toilets! You need to manually turn on the water to wash your hands manually flush the toilet and exit via a grab handle door - like something from the 1980's. Having been a member of One world for 10 years now I would have thought AA would have learned from BA/Cathay what an international lounge should be. Very limited selection of breakfast items (tiny muffins and tiny fruit salads). Only upside was plenty of PC access - I am stunned at how wide of he mark this ""upgrade to our facility"" is.

American Airlines,The Main lounge of American Airlines located between concourse H and K is well appointed staff friendly. Presented with one drink voucher each. The club was the same as it had been in 2000 when I use to frequent it. We found a place to hook up our laptops (we had to pay 14 USD each to hook up to the internet) drinks were expensive.

American Airlines,Without doubt the worst airline lounge I have ever used. I understand the lounge has been recently refurbished but the money has been wasted. The ambience is ruined by fluorescent lighting and it feels deathly quiet - there is absolutely no atmosphere. The furniture may be new but it is neither stylish nor comfortable the tables look like coffins! The food is basic cardboard tasting shrink wrapped in plastic and only snacks. There is no hot food. Beverages are worse. There were two bottles of red wine and of white both cheap quality - not what I would expect for such a ticket. Tea and coffee are of the do it yourself variety. Staff were disinterested and rather surly.,London Heathrow Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
American Airlines,Great lounge. Difficult to get to and find it during the transit from other terminal due to Narita airport passenger traffic logistics and how the signs are marked. The lounge needs to open earlier. There are passengers always waiting from 630 AM  until it opens 730AM. Checkin tends to take too long even after you have a passport ticket and Admiral Lounge membership card! The staff is extra courteous. Nice to have a few exercise machines to warm up.

American Airlines,I purchased a 1-day pass for 3 people in my family to use the Admirals Club in Dallas-Ft. Worth Admirals Club on the way overseas. I bought it online and ask the agent if there was free sandwiches snacks and alcoholic beverages. We wanted to get a cold beer and maybe cheese/crackers. The person said all this was free and when we got there I did not find any sandwiches free or alcohol. There was some trail-mix and pretzels cokes tea and water. The menu was an elaborate price to order anything else. We did not stay long and left. Delta clubs are better with choices of drinks (alcoholic or others) finger-foods and sandwiches.

American Airlines,We arrived LHR after 11 hour flight from Cape Town. We were told that there was no hot water for showers. For simple washing up the ladies room was not even stocked with towels or soap. My husband reported that the men's room was filthy. When I finally approached one of the staff for entry to the shower room for a cold shower she was less than pleased at the interruption and seemed quite put out. Seating was shabby and tired-looking.

American Airlines,Having flown AA for 20 years the Flagship Lounge/Admirals Club experience is one of my most disappointing with AA. The typical Admirals Club is rather tired has a poor selection of food and drink and are often crowded. Internet access has become one of the main reasons I keep my membership. The Flagship lounges (I have experienced LHR/ORD/San Juan) are better but typically quite small. It is mind boggling to me that they do not have one at their hub in DFW - but even these are nowhere near the quality of BA/Cathay for 1st class passengers. Their shower facilities are fairly decent with Chicago being recently upgraded but again Flagship do not have these - Admirals Club only. All in all not close to international standards with some of the lounges having totally insufficient bathrooms for the capacity of the lounge (ORD G Concourse is a good example - 1 toilet for men in a club with a 100+ capacity).,Unknown,2.0,3,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,no

British Airways,An update of a previous review from another customer. Three months after a fire and no reciprocal lounge facilities or vouchers for food and drink. I asked at the check-in counter how is it possible that British Airways is not taking care of this issue.

The lounge although has nice views over the tarmac did get too busy so I went across to the other Terraces Lounge.

The flight eventually took off at midnight - during that time there were no announcements no apology and passengers were sharing information they gleaned by questioning the staff at the desk Even when they called the flight at 10.45 - presumably to turf us out of the lounge - after a 10 minute walk to the gate we found the aircraft was still disembarking.

Food selection that resembles a self service cafeteria in a 1970's service station on the motorway. I was sent a survey by text from BA as I walked out of the lounge after being there for 5 minutes. I let them have my thoughts and they did call me.

British Airways,"There's nothing like a good lounge before your flight to make things easier - and this is nothing like a good lounge. It is the worst lounge I've ever used. Having said that it isn't quite as bad as some other reviews across the Internet might lead you to believe. We arrived about 90 minutes before our British Airways flight from Bordeaux to London Gatwick and the whole Club Europe check-in process was very friendly and smooth. We were issue with an invitation to the lounge; you then have to go through security (no fast track of course!) and present your invitation to the ""Cafe News"" on the airside. They will then give you the code for the lounge's front door. You have to enter this yourself; the lounge has no staff at all. However the member of staff at the cafe was very pleasant. There is a vending machine serving hot drinks which I found acceptable but be aware that the default choice adds sugar to everything which I did not want. There are a couple of local wines in a cooler and various spirits with soft drinks and mixers in the cooler. A few food items are available; in our case since we had a morning flight there were some quite fresh croissants and pains au chocolat which were actually quite good. The seating is rather old but not uncomfortable. The lounge itself was mercifully quiet which I suspect is usually the case for what is most probably a mainly holiday destination. Some of the tables could have used a quick clean but nothing serious here. So all in all if you can get a good price for your business class seat it may be worth it for the additional pre-flight comfort but anything like standard business class prices are definitely more than it's worth paying for this lounge.",Bordeaux Airport,2.0,4,3,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no
British Airways,I visited the new British Airways lounge yesterday after a 25 minute treck across the roof tops of the terminal building exposed to the elements. Do bare in mind that the 25 minute treck is just to get the new lounge you will need to add at least 40 minutes to get to the departure gates & through security. The new lounge appears to have less seats than the old lounge it is narrow & cramped & you still need to leave the lounge to use washroom facilities. The refreshments are very poor nothing as improved in this area so still a very poor selection of drinks & food & snacks. The furnishings are trendy as opposed to being comfortable & functional as well as being cramped with little privacy if you want to have your own space. At the moment I would not entertain visiting the British Airways lounge until the building work has been completed towards the end of 2015 as it is not worth the effort it takes to reach the lounge after check in or leave the lounge to get to the departure gate.

I arrived in the lounge at 8.45am - It was heavingno comfortable chairs to sit in and relax after a long flight dirty plates cups and rubbish left on most tables. I went to the ladies loo which had a long queue but very clean - and for a shower which I did not have to wait for which were clean and very good. Sadly the lounges area seems to be full to bursting on most occasions when I visit - it used to be a quiet relaxing lounge but on two occasions I have left and used my Priority Pass for the quieter No.1 Lounge downstairs. BA really need to enlarge this lounge as it really doesn't cope with the volume of passengers using it anymore. The staff are always helpful but there does need to be more of them in busy periods.

British Airways,Nice lounge in T3. Comfortable and ample seating. Beer available on draft which is a nice touch. Wine spirits and soft drinks. Wifi speed good enough for emails and web browsing and easy to log on. Sandwiches light snacks and soup. Only downside is that there is no view. Please be aware that to get from the lounge to the G gates involve getting on the shuttle train - so allow enough time. They make announcements when the flight is ready for boarding. I can confirm that the lounge does have its own toilets.,Rome Fiumicino Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,This lounge is an absolute disgrace. Lounge filthy toilets disgusting and food terrible. Baked beans curry and carrot soup what a cliche. There is some really serious work to be done here.,London Heathrow Airport,2.0,2,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,no
British Airways,This lounge is a disgrace for a national carrier at its home hub. The lounge is way overdue for a refurbishment - the chairs are old tatty and falling apart. The food is plentiful but poor and self service - so breathed and coughed over for hours.,London Heathrow Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,no
British Airways,Just awful. Way too many people. Food is terrible. I tried to have a beer but all of them were too warm. Plus there isn't much of a variety much Heineken Tiger or nothing. Wifi is slower than a 1990's dial up internet line. I travel quite often but even though I'm a Silver Member I rarely use the lounges anymore. I head elsewhere.,London Heathrow Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Dreadful new lounge. There is a 50 minute walk to the gate! Via a temporary roof walkway (till April I was told). By the time you have trekked over the roof of the airport it is not worth it. The lounge is small sparse cramped. Few facilities even the toilets are outside. Only breakfast items were small cartons of corn flakes. No milk provided. Thanks BA. Awful lounge not worth the visit.,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,1.0,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Way too busy staff that begrudgingly go about their jobs. Beginning to think that my membership of the executive club is now far less appealing than it used to be. I have travelled extensively on business and generally have a far better experience with Emirates or Singapore Airlines. Even the Lufthansa lounge at Heathrow has a better ambience. BA need to take the time to give this place a much needed uplift. If customers paying premium fares help BA survive more needs to be done to ensure they don't go looking for the premium service they pay for elsewhere.,London Heathrow Airport,1.0,1,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Lounge was dirty (very dirty) when I visited at 0915 on 27th January. Staff are beyond rude and standards have continued to drop every time I visit. Have they had a pay cut as they appear seriously unhappy and make an effort to be difficult and offhand to us paying customers. Sadly this is something I have noted onboard as well during last 2 long haul flights to Chengdu and back. Product is well below Asian airline competitors and Lufthansa and Air France are ahead of BA in the business class game. Amenities catering and service onboard Club World are a joke and I guess the only satisfied travellers are those who have never flown other airlines apart from BA.,London Heathrow Airport,1.0,2,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no
British Airways,All of the ambience and comfort of a hospital waiting room! Cramped with uncomfortable chairs arranged in squares with very few tables for plates and glasses. Poor selection of unappetizing food No showers. No Flight information displays. Very difficult to access with wheelchair - lifts are behind padlocked fire doors. The most disappointing lounge I have visited.,Rio De Janeiro Airport,1.0,1,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Busy busy busy. More people in the lounge than at the bars and restaurants outside. Nowhere to sit for the first hour then table sharing and bag stacking for the rest of my stay. Staff couldn't keep up with the mess and catering demand. Aside from the 12hr delay the BA lounges have gone downhill fast. Loud and messy chaos!!,New York JFK Airport,3.0,1,1,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
British Airways,Awful! No still bottled water - have to use a machine linked to the mains. Only a hot soup type thing and no other hot food. Dried sandwiches horrible coffee. BA - why do you bother with this lounge?,Calgary Airport,2.0,2,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,no
British Airways,I visit Toulouse nearly every week and this is the worst airport lounge I have experienced. Food selection poor drinks even worse which is unbelievable given we're in France - where's the wine? Interior decor is horrendous. The yellow red and green faux leather seats make it look like a 'wacky warehouse'. Its a shared lounge too and therefore way too cramped. BA nearly always has a full flight whenever I travel to TLS so I would expect them to help push for a lounge that its business travellers deserve!,Toulouse Airport,2.0,1,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,no
British Airways,Disappointingly cramped crowded and bare this was a surprisingly disappointing lounge with a paucity of refreshments and even these were in short supply. Given the significance of Schipol I was a little taken aback by the limited facilities (no loos inside the lounge for example). The staff were courteous but little else shone.,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,3.0,2,4,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,no
British Airways,A good experience. Helpful staff good refreshments in terms of quality and variety. The lounge itself disappoints a little as it has no bathroom facilities inside it and it is a rather plain room but more than adequate. Wifi was good and I suspect much could be improved by altering the seating plan and providing washrooms. Great location next to security and a pleasant enough stay.,Athens Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,A totally different experience from the usual BA self service arrangement which can be great or not so great. Everything is served from cooked to order meals in private booths to drinks at the bar. Generally of top class hotel fit out and a great 'outdoor' terrace overlooking the concourse. Get there early to fully enjoy it. The only annoying matter was the irritating background music. Switch it off!,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,I liked its quietness. Its cosy with comfortable sofas. Food options are limited but just enough for my needs : rice pasta chicken curry meatballs cheese salad bar snacks. Wine selection is small and champagne is self-service. The staff are attentive at reception and in the lounge. They come around with hot canapes.,Singapore Changi Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,My partner and I spent a relaxing couple of hours in this lounge. The atmosphere was quiet. Big comfy sofas and chairs a good range of soft drinks beverages and alcoholic drinks available as well as fresh fruit and yogurts in the fridges canapes sandwiches nuts and cakes. We didn't need wifi so can't comment on whether it was available. Previous reviewers have stated that the lounge doesn't have its own loos not true it does. But we did not see any showers available.,Rome Fiumicino Airport,3.0,5,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,yes
British Airways,Pretty poor for a first lounge. I've used plenty of the major airline's first class lounges: Qantas Cathay Emirates American etc: and considering this is the First Class lounge at BA's flagship terminal; I was pretty unimpressed. Firstly the breakfast was awful. The scrambled eggs on the buffet were more milk than egg. The coffee was out of a machine: no trained Barista and the menu that was available was very limited. I also had to queue for the toilets: not a shower. Just the toilets. Maybe this can happen in the business lounge but you just wouldn't expect this in first. Then it's the little things. I sat in quite a comfy seat with decent views but I could not charge my phone as there was no USB amenities. Also they had international power outlets but not Australian/New Zealand and I had already packed my adapters in my checked baggage. These are the type of small items that with a little thought can make a big difference to one's comfort whilst travelling. Sorry BA but you've failed. I'd look at what Cathay Pacific have done in Hong Kong and Qantas in Sydney. I love the Qantas first lounge in Sydney but Cathay's first class lounge in Hong Kong is spectacular.,London Heathrow Airport,1.0,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,no
British Airways,Lounge comfortable snacks and drinks sufficient. unable to relax due to noisy kids and to top it all a mouse was spotted running around near our bags. Flight delayed by over 2 hours this lounge closes at 8.30 unfair if your flight is delayed and you have paid for this privilege!,Orlando Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
British Airways,Really much improved my last visit here in May. The food was plentiful and of good quality the wine selection improved and the cleaning service coped well with a busy lounge. The dramatic improvement in internet is also noteworthy - no longer the inappropriate scratchcard system and now good quality wifi to which you can connect direct. Helpful staff and wonderful views. Excellent - well done on the improvements.,Madrid Barajas Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Cathay Pacific Airways,"I don't like this lounge at all, it is too small, very dated but at least it is clean. My worse complaint is the food choice is awful and very limited, even if you travel in the morning there is no breakfast food. I just wish they would update the lounge and specially give us proper foods. I still strongly recommend Cathay Pacific Airways, but not the Cathay Pacific lounge at Cebu!",Cebu Airport,1.0,2,4,1.0,1.0,3.1,2.0,3.0,yes
British Airways,BA has no control over this lounge as it is shared. Unbelievable that a brand new terminal would have shared facilities. It is an open bland fairly uninteresting space with a section 'cordoned' off for First Class pax. Food and drink the same for everybody. What is totally ludicrous is that in a brand new lounge in a brand new terminal there is only one men's and one women's toilet. Utterly inadequate.,Mumbai Airport,3.0,4,5,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,no
British Airways,I had an evening flight and the lounge was overcrowded. I travelled with a friend and it has very hard to find a place to sit down. There wasn't much space to relax in either once you found a spot. The plus side is that there was a good selection of sandwiches and decent WiFi.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,3,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,yes
Cathay Pacific Airways,"Flew BA to Prague and prefer the Cathay Pacific Airways lounge over BA. Food choice was excellent, chose the made to order noodles and they were excellent. A hot buffet was also available and I tried malaysian duck curry and it was great. My companion had carrot cake and cheese and was very happy. Decent choice of drinks and we drank about 4 flutes of the excellent Verve Clicquot champagne. My companion also had a shower and commented how lovely it was. The lounge had great views of the apron and runaway action.",London Heathrow Airport,10.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Cathay Pacific Airways,"The new lounge has just opened, huge Improvement on the old one. Open to all one world pax. The lounge is neutrally decorated with a good Thai menu. Not much else on offer at the moment but I think they're working on it, great bar and lots of staff around . Well done Cathay!",Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,10.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,3.1,3.3,5.0,yes
Cathay Pacific Airways,Too busy and small. Lounge used by a variety if other airlines hardly any seats and food drink not so good. I often don't bother. Considering there are so many flights from BKK to HKG I think a bigger lounge needed. Stop messing around with a first class lounge and just make a better one for everyone.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,no
British Airways,Very poor low grade business lounge. No champagne on offer unless you ask for it !! But very few staff around to ask. It looks tired with stained upholstery. Seats arranged in long functional rows along the walls - no different from the departure lounges. I normally fly Qatar or Emirates - they both know how to do Business Class -BA has either lost it's way or lost interest. It's been dumbed down to accommodate silver/gold card economy travellers. Fly Qatar or Emirates - even the Virgin Upper Class lounge is better than this.,London Heathrow Airport,2.0,2,2,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,no
British Airways,BA run lounges are usually good if sometimes overcrowded. Third party lounges like this vary. This one was dreadful - very little food limited range of drinks no computer access and very hard to find. I gave up and went to a bar to get a drink.,Hannover Airport,1.0,1,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
British Airways,"This is a fairly small and somewhat claustrophobic lounge. The chairs are comfortable enough. There is just about enough choice of drinks (no Campari) but an extremely limited choice of ""nibbles"" or anything else to eat. Also a very limited choice of newspapers - no Daily Telegraph for example. Our Amsterdam lounge experience was made singularly unpleasant by several lounge users conducting business into their mobile telephones at the top of their voices. After over half an hour of this anti-social behaviour my wife got up and told them that they were making so much noise she was unable to concentrate on the book she was reading. This lounge needs an area reserved for those who wish to utilise mobile telephones at the top of their voices! We were glad to leave the lounge.",Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,2.0,2,4,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,Tiny room. Lots of flights from BKK to HKG so already busy really not much there. Also other airlines use it. They really need a bigger one considering the amount of daily flights. Not much food to choose from.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,Atmosphere is acceptable and the noodle bar is a plus. But the noodle bar is hiding behind the washroom area and didn't even know the first time I was there. The food selection is small. The internet speed was as I tested about 3-5 mbps it's ok I guess. Staff courtesy is not so good. Nobody came to greet me at the lounge entrance. Some don't speak good English.,Hong Kong Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,Surprisingly small in size and lack of the luxury atmosphere which you would expect from an international airport which the airline has three A330 flight serving daily. Choice for breakfast items were limited - especially hot plates. I don't see chance for big refurbishment of the lounge due to relative size of MEL airport.,Melbourne Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,no
British Airways,"After Fast Track - instead of being able to walk about thirty yards to the Business (Club) lounge passing through the First Concorde Lounge - you have to walk left descend a floor walk back under where you have just walked and then take an escalater up again. What a nightmare. I am a disabled passenger but I was not allowed to walk through the Concord area to the Business Lounge - I was not amused. Certainly a user-unfriendly route from fast-track to the lounge. The Business Lounge is large and busy but looks increasingly ""tired"". They have stopped providing the Daily Telegraph and at the drinks area they have stopped providing Campari. The chairs and carpets appear very ""well-used"" and some of them appear to be well beyond their ""sell-by"" dates. Food provided was so-so - good croissants but uninspiring lunch choices. When this lounge opened it was wonderful. Today it does not hold a candle to the First Concorde lounge (which I have also used on eleven occasions). Although I recommend the lounge it is with some reservations.",London Heathrow Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,yes
British Airways,This lounge has a real problem With US Airways in Oneworld all AA and US travelers are trying to use it as it is much nicer than the either the Admirals Club or US Airways lounge.Staff are in the unenviable position of turning people away and denying guest privileges to keep it within the fire regulations for capacity. BA clearly needs to restrict to only BA travelers and EC card holders. JAL has no problem doing the same with their First lounge in Chicago due to space limitations.,Philadelphia Airport,4.0,4,4,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,This lounge is outdated needs a total refurb! I would be less than impressed if I had paid club prices for the experience. Furniture old staff rude drink and food selection exceptionally poor. You have to share a bottle of coke and the glasses are filthy and scratched and no wifi!,Rome Fiumicino Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,Agreed with comment made by Michael before considering the amount of BKK-HKG flights the lounge could really be improved. Small food and drink selection nice seating areas and it's quiet though. Hard to find. The Emirates lounge here and even the priority pass one next door are superior. Toilets are outside and there's loads of room to have one inside.,Hong Kong Airport,4.0,5,4,4.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,The lounge is a small place on the Mez floor between the main airport area and the gates in Section G. It is dingy and without much of a view. The furniture seems shipped over from HK as leftovers from the renovation there. Sat through chairs and chipped and worn tables. So it does not matter that people place their feet with the shoes still on on the tables. Staff are friendly (natural for Thai) but that is the best about it all. Drinks are standard only snacks and cup noodle soup on offer here. If you have the option move over to Louis Tavern lounge for superior service and experience.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,2.0,2,3,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,Very impressed with the quality and service received at all lounges. Amazing washroom facilities and quite areas for relaxing between flights. Food and drink was also very good!,Hong Kong Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,I think the earlier reviewer of this lounge must have been in a temporary lounge. The new BA lounge is spacious probably bigger than it needs to be and looks great. A much superior offering to what BA has to offer in other airports eg BKK and MIA. The wine selection is limited with two whites two reds and a champagne. Usual selection of beers and spirits. Good selection of sandwiches and cheese but no hot food other than Heinz tomato soup ! Staff are attentive wifi is good with decent speed. There's is no business centre and no tv screens so overall the lounge is a quiet area.,Singapore Changi Airport,4.0,4,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,I want to like it so much as it was the first lounge I ever used - but it is tired and needs a considerable refit and upgrade. Positives: good supply of drinks (of all types); nice open space; free wifi which is efficient. Negatives: wine was not cold; food was poor in terms of variety (just cheese/ham/salad) but fine in terms of quality; unusually the staff were not attentive or helpful (but that is unusual); poor seating space and decor/furniture really needs upgrade.,London Gatwick Airport,3.0,2,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,If you don't like one lounge you can try another and another and another. There is something for everyone and service beverages and calm environment.,Hong Kong Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Cathay Pacific Airways,This is the newly refurbished Cathay First Class lounge opposite (though upstairs from) Gate 2 at Hong Kong airport. I was disappointed and its very average. I understand the new interior is sleek and modern but when you look beyond that there's not much below the service. No snacks unless you go into the Haven for some crusty buffet food and waited several minutes for a shower attendant to appear and when she did she screeched something at me in Cantonese from the end of a hallway gesturing to a refurbished (though standard) shower you would find in any lounge. Aside from the furnishings I would suggest the Business Lounge next door offers more and certainly the QF First Lounge in Sydney or the BA First Lounge at LHR T5 are far superior. All in all what a disappointing effort from Cathay.,Hong Kong Airport,3.0,4,4,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,Quite comfortable but generally the size of the lounge is too small and feels a bit crowded and hot. Good wifi connection but not too many food choices available. Staff friendly and very nice. The lounge is located near the gates and flight information is provided which is convenient to passengers.,Fukuoka Airport,4.0,4,5,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,A bad anomaly at the fairly new Ataturk International airport in Istanbul compared with the excellent Star Alliance lounge which I have also used in the past. a scarred wooden floor with large dark gouges dirty armless chairs very closely spaced together dingy lighting a very limited and poor food and drink selection few information monitor screens located far from the boarding gates. In short a disaster rivaled only by the American Airlines lounge in Lima Peru.,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,2.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no
British Airways,I had the opportunity to visit the BA first class lounge in terminal 5. It was really crowded dirty and untidy. I had to make queue to use the bathroom. The food from the buffet was poor and the white wine was warm.,London Heathrow Airport,2.0,2,2,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,no
British Airways,Many good features but let down by wifi (you have to pay after 15 minutes of free use) and food (quality is fine but variety and quantity is disappointing). The drinks selection was very good the comfort certainly good and it was a busy though comfortable atmosphere.Not that easy to find it is friendly enough. The wifi issue is a considerable downside and the food was simply not plentiful enough - long periods without anything other than chips/crisps and then narrow range. Drinks - of all types - were plentiful and good quality. Seating was comfortable though the lack of power sockets was a little surprising.,Barcelona Airport,3.0,4,3,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,yes
Cathay Pacific Airways,I heard HK CX first lounge has been renovated but was disappointed. It was still under renovation Entrance staff at ground floor was rude particular the male staff. They treated different passenger differently as well. If you could stay there for a while observing the differences between passengers you will understand where I am coming from. Depends on the time you might be lucky to find a seat. Food at noodle bar is terrible I had some fried dumplings - it was not really cooked some parts still raw. Very limited food option tired staff working at lounge. It cannot compare with QF first lounge in Sydney not even match QF business lounge. Poor service poor quality of food limited space what else left with this lounge?,Hong Kong Airport,2.0,2,2,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,Floor to ceiling windows with a view of the apron and runaway and choice of food was excellent this included a buffer style English breakfast with some Singapore noodles but we opted to have some made to order soup noodles - superb. There were other snack and dessert items and a good choice of soft drinks. I had a raspberry juice which was just divine. If you are a One World Emerald member I seriously recommend this lounge at LHR T3.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Cathay Pacific Airways,Cathay Wing Lounge across from gate 2. Nice friendly welcome when entering the lounge. Short escalator ride that opens into a very airy setting with multiple seats and hostess around. Ample refreshments snacks and actual meals. Hot tasty and abundant. Lounge is located within easy reach of of Cathay's gates in that area. Plenty of space to work WIFI easy to access. One of the best features is the noodle bar. It is located on the opposite side of the entrance. 5 Choices and great. If you have a chance to try it -you will be very surprised and glad you took the time!,Hong Kong Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,The lounge is modern and does its job. We had a morning flight at 10.30. The lounge was very crowded bordering on congested. It is self service throughout. Being full made it a bit difficult to obtain food and drinks keep a reserved table and relax T the same time. There are many worse lounges. However BA should look at extending the area or redesigning to make the lounge less congested.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,3,3,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,It is a bit daunting when you first arrive but staff are surprisingly friendly and seemed genuinely interested in looking after you. Good baggage storage so you are free to enjoy. Three parts: the dining area - discreet cubicles with fast service and excellent food; a main lounge with various types of chairs to suit all needs; and a 'veranda' like place that although it is inside has excellent views across the tarmac. Seating here is more like a conservatory. (Spa and showers computer/business room but I didn't try any of these). Well worth getting to the airport 2hrs before your flight. Wifi a bit slow but adequate.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,yes
Cathay Pacific Airways,The newest lounge is quite impressive. Fantastic staff (waiting & counter staff) and a great selection of food. The solus chairs were also enjoyable as they allowed me to work and be comfortable at the same time. The waiting staff were employees of The Peninsula Hotel and made for a great experience.,Hong Kong Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Cathay Pacific Airways,The staff here are friendly; the lounge is comfortable with excellent food. The noodle bar is a must try. The lounge is becoming more congested which can make finding a seat difficult. My main gripe is the truly terrible wireless connection speed. It is now quicker to use my mobile's 3G service than the CX wireless. This has been getting steadily slower over time and now it is just not worth using.,Hong Kong Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,I found this lounge quite good for a short stay. Comfortable seating not crowded and good food/drink options available. The smoothie of the day and fresh panini sandwiches were a treat. One downside were the small restroom facilities which could be a problem during peak hours.,Hong Kong Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
British Airways,This lounge is a room nothing more! Four serving people hovered around a minimal amount of stewed food totally disinterested. Only sweet was ice-cream at the other end of the lounge. It didn't even have a flight screen! No place to leave luggage unlike some other BA lounges. Food was terrible: tough and tasteless. In the end I went to the Qantas lounge - you are allowed there and they were wonderful - they have a chef to cook for you. BA's lounge is a disgrace no views of the apron - only of arrival lounge/immigration. Haphazard boarding meant long queues and no fast-track so a long wait at the gate security.,Singapore Changi Airport,2.0,2,4,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no
British Airways,This lounge is generally OK but it wasn't when I arrived late morning on Sunday. It was overcrowded overheated and unpleasant. Most newspapers were unavailable. Having paid hundreds of pounds extra to fly Business on holiday I left immediately and ended up in a Cafe Rouge. I realize that lounges get busy at certain times of day but I don't understand why conditions need to be worse than at your average Starbucks or even (on this occasion) Café Rouge. I suggested to BA that they give me a refund. They said they valued my loyalty but no. Oh well. Fortunately the flight was good but I am assuming lounges are taken into consideration when evaluating airlines for stars and recent lounge experiences have made me wonder if BA's four stars might be too generous.,London Gatwick Airport,2.0,2,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,no
British Airways,What a shock. The lounge was dated in Poor disrepair and quite frankly grim. It needs refurbishing badly and it was way too small for the number of travellers using it. The No 1 Lounge is way better but they could learn a lot by visiting the Virgin lounge at Heathrow - it Is a million times better. BA need to buck their ideas up here!,London Gatwick Airport,2.0,1,3,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,Very ordinary. Feels like it is in the dungeons of the airport. Limited selection of food drinks. More entertainment available within the terminal.,Melbourne Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,Showers were good with nice extras. Did not find any computers would appear they only provide wifi. Asked for a cabana but told that's only available in the first section of The Wing. Overall quiet pretty spacious and well positioned.,Hong Kong Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,no
British Airways,Despite having a BA Business Class ticket I was declined admittance to the Business Class Lounge! The (very helpful polite and just lovely) lady at the BA Customer Service Counter informed my that my ticket wasn't the right type of Business Class ticket to gain access to the lounge. Given the fact I have a One World First Class around the world ticket I have to ask what exactly is an acceptable ticket! The gentleman at the Business Class counter (also terribly polite and most sympathetic and helpful) informed me that QANTAS Frequent Flyer Club members are no longer allowed in the BA Lounge as they no longer pay BA for the privilege! British Airways pick up your game.,London Heathrow Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Great lounge relaxing and food generally good - have noticed cuts in premium spirits crisps and total lack of decent magazines which is a shame as BA makes all it's profit out of its business class passengers.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes
Cathay Pacific Airways,I would agree that this lounge is often overcrowded and looks rather frayed now. Staff were friendly on my visit and quick to offer service. Table service good though food selection has lost its shine compared to a couple of years ago.,Hong Kong Airport,3.0,3,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,Cathay Pacific Lounges at HK International Airport used to be a benchmark but have lost their edge over past 2 years. Overcrowded with wear and tear generally showing throughout. Noodle bars in Business Class lounge or seated dining area okay if you can get a table. Most of the times better to grab a bite to eat outside and use the chairs available at the gates. Cathay needs to take care of premium customers better or accept losing clients.,Hong Kong Airport,2.0,3,3,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,Just a dreadful experience. The staff was discourteous rude. They ignored my plea for help to correct the wireless problems claiming they could not speak English or help me. It was as if I was troubling their time when I was flying first transpacific and waiting for another lengthy flight onward. The shower was clean if basic. The buffet food sub-par. The lounge looks unclean and tired and not worthy of first class.,Hong Kong Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Excellent lounge from which BA could learn a great deal. Very comfortable seating with good views of the apron and runways and superb food. The food was fresh and delicious with a station cooking rice or noodle stir fry dishes to order. Maybe the best hot food in an airport lounge I have ever experienced.,Toronto Pearson Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,I was allowed access as I had just travelled to Heathrow with BA in First. My excitement at being allowed into this hallowed space was short lived. It looked congested and untidy. The service for anything from a full meal to a glass of water is waiter only. Empty glasses and used plates were waiting to be cleared from a lot of the tables. As I had only recently eaten on the inbound flight I did not bother to order any food but still tried one of the booths in the dining area which seemed reasonably comfortable and private. I moved to sit 'outside' on the balcony overlooking the departures area as it felt less claustrophobic. After waiting 10 minutes for a coffee I quickly drank it and went to the First/Gold lounge which had a more comfortable and relaxing ambience.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,2,2,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,Maybe it was the time I visited this lounge but there were so many passengers entering but not enough seats. After walking around for 10 minutes with my wife and daughter I was finally able to secure some seats. Granted the area around the seat had not been cleaned for a while which resulted in heaps of dirty plates and glasses. With seats secured I waited to see if anyone would clean up the plates/glasses. Someone did arrive 15 minutes later to clean it up. The lounge was chaotic around 1-30pm on a Saturday with way too many people and not enough seats. The noodle bar is always good but the sandwiches and other items were not as good. Good supply of drinks/ beverages. As another poster stated the lounge is really showing wear and tear. It is sad because this lounge and The Pier are the barometer for all other Cathay Pacific lounges. Another gripe I had was the elevator that connects the lounge to the departure gates way too small and slow. If I was in a rush I probably would have missed my flight despite it only being 7 minutes away at Gate 21. It may be better to grab a bite to eat outside and enjoy the spacious seats at the gates if the lounge continues to be way it was when I visited.,Hong Kong Airport,3.0,4,2,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,I little dated and old despite the newness of the Airport. Friendly welcoming staff not bad choice of drinks and food. None of the electric sockets worked where I was seated. Not too crowded. Internet and computers available for public use.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,3,3,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,Friendly efficient staff compliment a large open plan lounge the looks out over the airport. There is a great little restaurant style noodle bar with a selection of Chinese food but watch out if you are looking for more western cuisine as it is lacking. So to is the selection of drinks which seems to have shrunk in recent years possibly due to cut backs. There is a large room with multiple PC terminals for good reliable internet surfing. Wi-Fi is free and up to par with speed and reliability. Restrooms and Shower cubicles are small and showing a little wear and tear as the years go by. However they are clean! Overall this is a great lounge but slowly starting to show some of its age.,Hong Kong Airport,4.0,4,5,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no
British Airways,I had just earned my Silver Executive Club membership and was looking forward to trying out a lounge on my own account without being a guest of one of my better traveled colleagues. Unfortunately my first experience was at one of the lounges at Ben Gurion. It was small crowded and oppressively stuffy. The decor was straight out of the 70s; huge dimly lit lampshades shiny brown worn polyester seat covers and chrome and smoked glass coffee tables adorned with sticky glass rings which was odd since the rest of the terminal seemed quite new. Once I found a seat I was reluctant to leave it unattended but eventually went to the refreshments counter where I eventually found a lukewarm bottle of beer but no suitable glasses. There was food on offer as well but I gave it a miss as I did with the other facilities preferring to go back out into the main departure area which in comparison was bright clean and refreshingly air conditioned. To be fair to BA though the lounge appears to be shared by many airlines so they probably don't have much influence over how its run. Just be prepared for disappointment if you're visiting this airport.,Tel Aviv Airport,2.0,1,1,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,no
British Airways,A very small and miserly stocked lounge. No hot food small selection of booze and no espresso.,Unknown,3.0,3,4,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,The lounge was small compared to other Cathay lounges I have been at. There was the ever constant noodle bar serving up good food. They had two types of sandwiches (vegetarian and w/ meat) and they had cake + chinese dim sum. Good varieties of drinks including premium liquor and soft drinks. The lounge itself does not compare to the Wing or Pier lounges in HK but for Taipei it provides a nice oasis for travelers to eat and drink prior to their flight. It is a better alternative to the lacklustre duty free that is provided at Taoyuan airport. If there try the beef noodles in soup and not the spicy peanut sauce based noodles. There was free wifi and it was fast as well. Overall a very nice place to spend an hour or two before one's flight.,Taipei Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,Haven't been to this lounge since before the renovations but what a difference. Great layout with a combination of lounge seating bar and workstations along the lines of other CX lounges and plenty of filtered light. Good food drink and reading material selections.,Melbourne Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,As a Diamond Frequent Flyer I enjoy this lounge quite regularly. And regularly experience the comfort excellent service wonderful showers fantastic staff great catering and the WOEFUL internet connection. Which drops out regularly. It seems three wireless services are available but they seem to drop out randomly without rhyme or reason. Even while typing this the connection failed twice. Not good enough Cathay Pacific.,Hong Kong Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,no
British Airways,Very nice little and quiet lounge right at the back of the terminal. Staff were very attentive. The food wasn't great and neither was the choice just a few sandwiches and biscuits to choose from. The wifi was fast and the lounge was clean. But there was a queue in front of the washrooms because there is pretty limited capacity.,Vancouver Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,An oasis of calm in what can be a busy terminal 3. Always plenty of seats with many overlooking the runway. It never seems busy here even though its used by American Airlines and now US Airways. An 8am departure - good choice of continental breakfast items. Everything you would expect from a lounge.,Manchester Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Cathay Pacific Airways,Have to say I was rather disappointed with this flagship lounge for Cathay. It seems to have a rather worn appearance the seats were quite tatty and dirty same for carpet areas and staff service was cold at very best. Nicest staff was the lady cleaning the shower rooms! Did not get to use the cabanas this time but found the shower-rooms rather cramped and dull for a first class facility in Asia. Had a snack in the dining room area and whilst it was quite good again I found the staff to be quite offhand and poor. Had problems with wifi but probably my fault and not that of the lounge service here.,Hong Kong Airport,3.0,4,3,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,Large lounge. Reasonably comfortable with ample seating some overlooking the aircraft apron. Many Internet stations in good working condition. Well-stocked with snacks and drinks including Dim Sum and wine. Good selection of magazines and newspapers. Two shower rooms and a few toilet cubicles all in sparkling condition. The lounge is not enclosed but sits open-air one level above the general departure area accessible by escalator and lift.,Singapore Changi Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,Not much has changed since my last visit to this lounge. Seats were old and dirty. Food selection was mediocre at best. The redeeming quality of this lounge is the attentiveness and willingness of the staff to help the guests.,Manila Airport,4.0,4,3,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,The new lounge at Glasgow is a vast improvement on the old one very well laid out good selection of food and drinks. Staff on the desk very helpful and the lounge staff very attentive at both replenishing food/drinks as well as clearing used glasses etc away. Top tip sit in the whiskey snug hidden around the back and with no one in it. Only slight draw back is that it's not immediately at the gate but can live with that.,Glasgow Prestwick Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,First time in this Lounge. Very disappointing 6pm food was curry chilli jacket potato with beans - really inspiring. Tables left dirty for over 15 minutes.,London Heathrow Airport,2.0,3,3,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,no
British Airways,Lounge is ok but front desk staff are extremely rude and unhelpful. We were travelling with small children and needed a little extra assistance but no such luck. Highlights yet again vast difference in treatment between UK BA lounges and those stateside where your gold card often seems as welcome as tax bill.,Miami Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,no
Cathay Pacific Airways,Cathay Pacific really underestimated the frequency of the shower room. It's always more than an hour waiting while I only have 2 hours transit time.,Hong Kong Airport,3.0,1,5,4.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,no
British Airways,Furnishings and refreshments fine for the amount of custom but there were no showers available and the nearby toilets were out of use. The there computers available but the internet connection was extremely poor and very unreliable.,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,3.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,no
British Airways,Food quality has gone down especially if you're looking for any protein. Breakfast before transatlantic flight was largely a selection of pastries and other unhealthy options. No cheese no eggs just lots of toast and low quality croissants. The food bar is not well maintained and everything reeks of cheapness and cost cutting from the biscuits and crisps to the wine selection. I asked for cheese and was rudely told there's none available before noon if then. The toilets are often smelly and not clean enough. There is often a queue to get in. It's a shame BA don't realize how this damages their brand. They've been cutting down on meals on board too of course but in the lounges it's really apparent. Hardly worth paying the extra fares; better to save the money and take your own high quality comestibles perhaps.,London Heathrow Airport,2.0,3,1,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Pretty awful. No wifi or printers working. Food minimal and very drab. Quite crowded not much space. Toilets far away outside.,Rome Fiumicino Airport,2.0,1,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,no
British Airways,Overall extremely disappointing. I used the lounge on a Saturday 10am - 1.30pm Large lounge with comfortable chairs and free wifi as you would expect little choice of newspapers no phone/tablet charging points. Coffee etc available choice of wines and spirits if you are hungry I suggest you eat beforehand! Hot food consists of toast. Cold food consists of fruit salad plain yoghurt in a large bowl (not single pots) ham and cheddar cheese plus pastries & biscuits. Heathrow has slightly more choice incl hot food.,London Gatwick Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,no
British Airways,The British Airways staff at T5 certainly didn't go to charm school. Awful choice of food ended up with a jacket potato lounge lacked character and looked dirty. Staff on the entrance uninterested and took no notice of me. The toilets in the business lounge were so dirty I changed my mind about taking a shower!,London Heathrow Airport,2.0,1,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Not made to feel especially welcome and when we were there at lunchtime there were not many places left to sit. Not crowded but very 'busy'. The hot food surprisingly for me and very strange for foreign visitors was pea soup! That was all - and some weird croutons. Uninspiring salad bar with no 'wow' factor whatsoever and three types of freshly-made sandwiches - ham and cheese chicken prawn with rose-marie sauce. All of them sorry to say utterly tasteless! The good news is thank goodness the excellent wines available and Champagne (for that you have to ask an over-worked but smiling waitress who will eventually bring it to where you are sitting) Usual premium spirits selection with mixers. Toilets (men) were frankly a bit grubby and dated and a tad smelly - not good enough! More like a traditional English pub on a Saturday night. Overall very underwhelmed with the whole experience and compared with other business class lounges at Heathrow and overseas in Middle East down at the bottom of the list - desperately needs upgrading to bring in line with competitors.,London Gatwick Airport,3.0,3,3,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,no
British Airways,I visited this lounge on 24 May 2014. Warm and pleasant welcome on arrival to the lounge. The main lounge is effectively a rectangle with a small annex to one side with some additional seating and tables. Decent selection of English and French language newspapers but a more limited selection of magazines. Wifi worked well - it was easy to connect and I was pleased with the speed. The lounge was relatively quiet when I visited and had a pleasant quiet atmosphere. A menu was available on the food counter but the food selection is fairly limited - all cold food with some meat and some cheese sandwiches available along with nuts crisps cakes fruit and biscuits - I personally thought that although the selection was limited this was satisfactory given that it is a short haul outpost language. Luggage storage available. Toilet located outside lounge. Overall a pleasant (albeit not amazing) place to spend an hour before a flight.,Geneva Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,For such a fantastic potential this remains a disappointing lounge. Wonderful views a very large area pretty good seating light and airy - all good. However: after over an hour in here we are getting the first sign of a cleaner; food is almost non existent (I mean this literally!) and the range and quality of drinks has declined over time. Inattentive staff the frustrating wifi system of getting scratchcards every 30 minutes and the paucity of refreshments leaves this well below bar. The long trek to T4S would be fine if we had something better when we arrived!,Madrid Barajas Airport,2.0,4,2,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Food non existent staff unhelpful totally unimpressed. Internet wireless not working correctly either. Can't wait to get on the plane and get out of this hole.,Rome Fiumicino Airport,2.0,1,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Both the north and south lounges in T5A are superb. Reception staff always friendly despite some miserable people who seem to complain a lot and should be kicked back to the public areas. The lounges are always busy but there are plenty of seats of many types. The showers are excellent staffed by such friendly ladies and whilst there is often a queue to use the toilets they are spotlessly clean. Good choice of food of sandwiches salads and hot items. The lentil and bean curry was spicy and excellent as was the Thai red curry. Two types of perfectly cooked rice or baked potato. Wide range of alcoholic drinks. The wifi is free easy to log on and of good enough speed despite many people using it. And a great view over airport. I always look forward to coming here.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,Visited the Concorde Room on 2 May and used it for around ten hours. I stored my hand luggage with the attendant and proceeded to the dining area for breakfast. All food served in this lounge is waiter service and menus are scattered around the lounge for you to choose your selection from and change depending on the time of day. If you visit the First Galleries Lounge opposite the Concorde Room you can request items from their buffet selection and they will be served to you in the Concorde Room. There was a good choice of premium spirits and champagnes as well as teas coffees and soft drinks. I booked one of the private cabanas when I organised my trip which is a dedicated day room with bed TV shower toilet free telephone use and room service. You can request a cabana for a maximum of four hours it's an oasis of calm within an oasis of calm. I also had lunch and afternoon tea there good quality food and friendly and efficient service. I also used the Elemis Spa facilities which can be booked twenty eight days in advance if you are a First passenger. There is also a boardroom style facility to log on to the internet and printers so you need to produce any paperwork. My only criticism is that some of the soft furnishings are beginning to wear slightly.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,Smallish lounge shared by several airlines. Very pleasant staff and free bar for BA customers. Excellent showers mediocre food offerings. Other airline users pay for alcoholic beverages.,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,Rome Fiumicino Arrivals Terminal is a nightmare but International Departures Terminal Four is state of the art. Even on the busiest weekend of the year—canonization of John Paul II and John XIII—the space was remarkably civilized. The terminal raised expectations for the executive lounge. We were flying Turkish Airlines - in Rome they use British Airways executive lounge. The lounge size is adequate but not much was done with it. Apart from a series of good abstract prints and a series of photographs of architectural details of Rome the space is clinical. Solid blocks of rectilinear grey-beige vinyl sofas and matching chairs suggest that travelers necessarily move in groups of ten -–the squares are intimidating for parties of one or two but once these islands are occupied even by a single traveler they become impenetrable by others. One side of the space is plate glass blindingly bright so only half of the seating cells can be comfortably occupied. Especially for travellers suffering from jet lag the initial unsettling affect of the anti-intimate seating and hyper lighting is subtly exacerbated of other details of the ambiance. The floor carpeted in a non-descript blue felt-like substance is not as might be expected flat. Rather it rises and falls in just such a way as to make you stumble. Internet connection is available but requires an inordinately complex set of interventions to access. Once acquired it is difficult to find one of the few plugs that is not already being used by another harried voyager. The culinary experience like the digital environment is disconcerting. We were arrived at 1 p.. lunchtime. Cereal and yogurt was on offer as well as croissants and cookies. Breakfast apparently lasts all day at the BA lounge. There was a self-serve bar which included red and white wine. The red came in a Bordeaux bottle but it tasted like it had been decanted from a box. Our empty glasses stayed with us during the entirety of our wait.,Rome Fiumicino Airport,2.0,1,2,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,no
British Airways,Absolutely shocking. Stale and tasteless lumps of bread. Food in fact that I would be more likely to throw out. Disinterested staff. Without doubt with regards to the food on offer this was the worst I'd ever been to. Nothing to do with British Airways incidentally. We were given access by means other than our airline tickets.,Rome Fiumicino Airport,2.0,3,3,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no
British Airways,For a small airport this lounge was excellent. It was elegant clean and had a respectable selection of food and beverage.,Malta Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,The worst business lounge I've ever seen. There is little food available; what there was consisted of a few different small cakes (I think) packaged snacks and mixed nuts. There is a reasonable selection of drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic but the ice was in an open ice bucket and mostly melted; dried-up slices of lemon on a plate. There is no separate bathroom; you have to use the general public ones outside the lounge. The decor is a particularly unpleasant shade of pale purple. All in all it's a most unwelcoming prospect.,Sofia Airport,2.0,3,4,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no
British Airways,At OSL BA uses the OSL lounge (owned by airport authorities). I often take the late BA flight to LHR after work. If hungry eat somewhere else - food and beverages are below standard for BA lounges. Decent selection of newspapers. Best feature: The lounge is wonderfully quiet. So worth visiting after long day at work to wind down before the flight. Very comfortable chairs and sofas (though not particularly modern or elegant) and a quiet atmosphere. I like it. About 10 mins walk to BA gates from lounge.,Oslo Airport,4.0,4,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,The quality of the food is dropping every time I spend some times in this lounge. Chilli con carne without proper rice ice cream fridge empty quality of wine getting lower and lower. I also found surprising that nothing is done in the last year to fix some power sockets that do not work (next to seat or on the PC table). It seems that BA believe that quality of service is not important for the price of ticket you have to pay. Maybe they will have a wake-up call like Lufthansa when people will fly different airlines.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,3,4,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no
British Airways,I think the standard has gone downhill. It's not as clean as before. The wine is mediocre. No bread or nice cheese. The coffee beans are not the same. No more nice different cookies just a pot with a cookie that's has the taste of nothing. I was happy to pay the price for Club to be able to get in. But as for now no way.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,4,2,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,no
British Airways,Plenty of light snacks of crisps flapjacks brownies biscuits and soup. The choice of drinks was impressive choice of wines beers and spirits. The lounge ambience was not the best but very functional. Something to note if you arrive early the check in desks may not be open until a couple of hours before departure and the self service machines will no longer be available.,Jersey Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,yes
British Airways,You need to have the One World Gold card to access this lounge if you're travelling business class. Lounge offers space; comfortable seating great showers and washrooms and a spa with a very good massage for free (but most often fully booked). A great buffet with a wide choice (chilli con carne one of the best I've ever had) with a number of dishes you can order from the waiters. A huge wine selection of very good wines and vintage champagnes.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,Spotlessly clean relaxing and fantastic views of airside and runway. Service by staff very friendly and welcoming. There is storage for your luggage if you want to dump everything and relax or walkabout (though Newark airport has few shops/duty-free). Lounge only has 1 shower. The food really was amazing. Worth getting to the airport early enough to eat.,Newark Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,Very spacious and great views. We experienced breakfast and lunch which were adequate but not as good as the Heathrow T5 lounge. The hot food was too limited. Porridge and soup offerings were tasty and nice champagne.,London Gatwick Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,yes
British Airways,Use this lounge 2-3 times a month and position is okay subject to which A gates you board from. It is cramped not just at peak times and BA seem to have become complacent about improving this. Toilets can be very risky unless you catch at the moment they have just been cleaned and often filthy and unpleasant. Food is at Travelodge level (UK travellers will know what I mean) and fails to match standards at some better European airline lounges. Staff at reception only want to see a card or boarding pass and I think these must be the ones that didn't make the grade at charm school. Don't get me wrong I like BA but their lounge standards (including First) here at Terminal 5 are now poor.,Unknown,2.0,2,2,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
British Airways,I appreciate this lounge is never going to be empty but I always find the lounge too busy to be comfortable. On my last visit just before New Year cups and glasses took a relative age to be removed and the food choices seemed less than usual along with having to queue to use the toilet. I've had decent stays in this lounge but the last two visits haven't been relaxing or pleasurable. It's got to the point where I've ended up at the Espresso cafe at the very end of the southern part of T5.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
British Airways,BA use the JAL Sakura Business Lounge at NRT. Spacious clean and a separate dining area if one wanted to eat. Decent tarmac views. Nice lounge and a pleasant way to spend an hour or so.,Tokyo Narita Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,Disappointing and poor quality. From the challenge in finding the lounge to the surly receptionist to the very poor range of snacks this was a real disappointment. I was flying British Airways and it is to be hoped that they will try to persuade the airport to improve this lounge. Small in size basic in furnishings poorly lit. One bottle of wine only in the whole lounge and a choice of one type of beer. Snacks with very little choice and poor quality. Lavatories were outside of the lounge. Unhelpful staff.,Turin Airport,2.0,1,3,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Much improve. They have enlarged the lounge and offer a reasonable range of snacks sandwiches and drinks. The beer/wine is fine and the snacks of a good quality. Friendly staff and excellently located. Clean well maintained. I suspect they will need to upgrade it more for the 2018 World Cup as it is relatively basic by some standards but is none the less safe quiet clean and friendly. I have been to this lounge many times -it does its job.,St Louis Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,I am a gold member with BA. On 28th December I was flying to Tampa with my wife and three youngsters that we care for access to the lounge was denied which I accepted but not having seen the notice not to remove refreshments when I took three small soft drinks and three packets of crisps out to the children I was virtually attacked on my return with a BA staff member waving his finger at me stating it was a massive No no for me to do this. I was publicly humiliated with his loud out burst for what I thought to be a small crime! The staff member was rude arrogant and had zero customer service skills I would like to name and shame but feel this would lower me to his level. On our quick exit I did point out to him that I had seen numerous other clients taking stock from the lounge but this observation was ignored. BA have responded to my complaint stating that they have passed my concerns onto the LGW management team.,London Gatwick Airport,2.0,3,1,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Busy lounge in T5A South before New Year. Very dark and uninviting. Limited viewing area most of the seats face inward the building. Very limited choice of food - few sandwich one soup and some cakes. Good selection of wines but depends on where you sit. Good wifi. Service was very slow (not attentive) and the receptionists weren't welcoming. A very disappointing lounge.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,3,3,4.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,yes
British Airways,Terrace Lounge in Aberdeen has just been renovated. Friendly staff spacious seating/working area and good selection of soft drink also one red/white wine on offer. Food is limited to sandwich and cakes but that's sufficient for a regional airport.,Aberdeen Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,0.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,This new lounge opened just a week ago. It is absolutely appalling. There is no food All the trays are empty. Juice dispensers are empty. Coffee machines don't work. Only a few packets of cheap biscuits in a basket. When I asked the staff (who was rude and unhelpful) if the trays and juice dispensers would be refilled the answer was no and he walked away. This was 10am. The lounge looks pleasant and comfortable enough. In the end orange juice was made available but we would have to approach the staff to ask for it. WIFI is not free.,Turin Airport,2.0,4,2,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Not an experience I will repeat  poor service very slow which in hindsight was a blessing given the quality of the food when it finally arrived. To see how a lounge should be run fly Qatar Airways.,London Heathrow Airport,2.0,2,3,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,no
British Airways,This might not have the 'wow factor' of Terminal 5 lounges it is very good. A fairly long trek to get there but efficient friendly professional more spacious than you first think. Good internet excellent range of wines. Food is good quality though a little lacking in variety and with tiny plates! Good variety of seating and very pleasant environment. You can work relax sleep or whatever you need to here. Clearing up service seems a little under staffed as used plates and glasses can take a long time to be collected - but BA would benefit from more staff on this duty the ones who are there are good.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,bustle of the main terminal. Very efficient staff clearing away welcoming reception staff. Breakfast food is excellent. Wide selection of excellent wines and other drinks. Good internet and very clear information boards. It does get busy of course but manages this well. Clean bathrooms.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,Very good overall. I have visited this lounge a number of times - the variety of food can be a little inconsistent at times but the quality is good with a good mix of cold and warm snacks salads etc. Good range of drinks and nice selection of wine - though it is a pity that the Cava has seemingly been withdrawn! Comfortable large bright with natural light and excellent view of the runway - huge glass front the lounge which extends along its whole length. Reception is friendly and professional. Wifi system is frustrating - you have to collect scratchcards from reception which only last 30 minutes - seems unnecessary. Its a little bit of a challenge to find the lounge but well worth when you do.,Madrid Barajas Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,FCO-LGW I entered the lounge after a long a hot journey to the airport. The lounge was quiet and it was being shared by the other one world airlines. There was no hot or cold food there were only crisps. There were plenty of drink options. I was very disappointed as British Airways have a few flights out of Rome to London Heathrow London Gatwick and London City.,Rome Fiumicino Airport,2.0,3,3,1.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,no
British Airways,Surprisingly poor. The pre-flight buffet was unappetizing. I found nothing I wanted to eat and the staffer on the door to that section (keeping away other airline's passengers) was unfriendly to the point of rudeness. The main lounge is horribly lit. You have to find someone if you want a glass of Champagne and there are not that many staff around. It is so different from Virgin's lounge at JFK I'm just confused. By contrast the BA lounge at City Airport in London is fine.,New York JFK Airport,3.0,3,3,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no
British Airways,The BA all-business service to JFK was a fine flight. The lounge at City is surprisingly good for a fairly small space. The snacks and drinks were fine and staff serving was friendly and efficient. (The hike to the washrooms is tiresome.),London City Airport,3.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,I received complimentary use of this lounge when I took an Iberia flight that connected in NY. I heard that BA has great lounges so I was looking forward to it. It was a letdown to say the least. I was greeted to 3 stale inch-wide sandwich slivers on a tray set off to the side. Bottles of water had not been replenished. I was starving and asked they would be replenishing food/drinks etc. I was told that everything would arrive around 6 - when I asked this question it was about 2 pm. It was also extremely hot in the lounge; hot to the point where certainly something must have been wrong with their air systems. Pay for use of this lounge? Not a chance. In fact you'd have to pay me.,New York JFK Airport,2.0,1,2,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,no
British Airways,British Airways Galleries First lounge at JNB is the worst airport lounge I have visited. BA should be absolutely ashamed to call this a lounge much less a first class lounge. Slow unusable internet poor or non-existent service. Lousy food which is identical to the adjoining business lounge Champagne sitting in lukewarm water with no ice for 2 hours.,Johannesburg Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Easy to find but very uncomfortable to sit in. Choose between massive armchairs that are far too big or sit at the small tables that are used for eating on rock hard dining chairs. Good range of drinks on offer but limited snacks. Only 15 minutes Wifi free any more you pay for.,Barcelona Airport,3.0,2,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,no
British Airways,Busy but not over-full. I arrived for some lunch snacks before 1455 Marrakech departure. I'm vegetarian so it would be appreciated if the sandwiches could be labelled. Plenty of salad options and quiche or soup but plates are a bit on the small side. Alcoholic drinks available on a self-service basis but it appeared a glass of fizz was available if you asked for it (I saw it being carried out to people). The big drawback about this lounge is that it doesn't have enough power points. The only ones I could find were situated next to seats right round the L shaped lounge to the left. Also it's not clear to passengers where the toilets are if you miss them on the way in. Loads of people are left wandering aimlessly around the computer area only to have walk back all the way round to the entry/exit. Signs? The coffee is still excellent from the machine - why it's so foul onboard Club Europe is anyone's guess. My only other moan is that unless you're a frequent flyer from LGW it's not clear how far the gate is from the lounge. No map on the mobile app nor anything in the Highlife magazine. Gate 54 appeared and I wasn't sure if I had to walk all the way over that irritating airbridge which adds another 10 minutes to your journey.,London Gatwick Airport,4.0,3,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,This lounge has a very limited range of food and drink but this would be just about acceptable if there was somewhere to escape the relentless sax led funk background music. Dreadful.,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
British Airways,We had a two hour wait in the lounge and found it to be very comfortable and the complimentary hot and cold food was excellent. There was a complimentary bar as well. Free Wi-Fi and special areas for viewing TV programs and also working areas with desktop computers.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,Much improved from my last visit 3 years ago. WiFi is available the bathrooms are in the lounge. It is air conditioned. It is bigger. Good selection of drinks although you have to ask the desk to replenish. Snacks only. Very good for a regional airport.,Toulouse Airport,3.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,yes
British Airways,The last time I visited the LGW BA Terraces lounge it was on two floors - now there is only one. Entry was fast and there is a good selection of food and drinks on offer. It was about midday and there was a full and extensive salad buffet with cold cuts. There was also a selection of sandwiches. The wide drinks selection is there. But the sheer volume of passengers makes it like a January sale. BA has removed a number of flights from Gatwick and moved them to Heathrow and halved the floor space of its lounge as a result. However the remaining floor space isn't enough for the flights still operating from Gatwick. So expect crowds empty food trays no drink glasses and occupied showers. Rest assured that the sandwiches will never be stale - they are never available long enough to get that way.,London Gatwick Airport,3.0,4,3,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,yes
British Airways,"Superb level of service - attentive and friendly without being ""over the top"". Excellent range of wine and other drinks. Very good food. Calm and relaxed atmosphere. Excellent washroom facilities.",London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,Much better than the North Lounge. Ample breakfast food. Comfortable and serene. Recommended.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,Decent food on offer cheese cakes a curry mushroom soup and some thai titbits that were very tasty. Reasonable wine choice mainly Australian including sparkling wine rather than champagne. Staff were very efficient at clearing plates. There appeared to be plenty of showers although I didn't need to use them. The only negative was painfully slow WiFi I gave up trying. I also tried to JAL lounge it was more spacious but BA had better drink and marginally better food.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,Ridiculously busy dirty and poor food. How did BA ever sink so much? The North lounge at Heathrow is now beyond the pale and the south lounge is not much better. It is not a pleasant experience and compares unfavourably to the Virgin lounge at Heathrow by some distance. It's hard to find any privacy in these lounges. The food at best is of average quality and I am unsurprised to read that the Food Standards Agency has ordered improvements in basic hygiene levels in these lounges. I'm afraid I too myself off to the Eat cafe for coffee. I felt the £1.75 I paid there was better value and certainly the coffee was better. Shame on you BA. For the prices you charge you should treat your Club class passengers with more respect.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,2,2,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,no
British Airways,This is the worst lounge that I have been in. Breakfast only sweet biscuits sweet croissants some sandwiches - early in the morning and once the food is gone it is gone. So do yourself a favour and do not come to the Le Anfore lounge as it is not worth the trouble. I would hate to think what they charged Qantas for the orange juice and the coffee we had.,Rome Fiumicino Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,no
British Airways,"Overall a disappointment even with a discount. Because time blocks are sold based upon your departure time we were obliged to ""buy"" 3-hours of access when we only needed two. On the plus side the lounge is calm airy comfortable and has great views of the tarmac. On the other hand staff were indifferent and insufficiently aware of the needs of the ""buffet"" station. The food itself was barely okay. Selection and quality were narrow. The ""hot"" dishes most certainly were not and I worried about that. Wine selection was also okay. House selection(s) were Canadian brands. Was it worth $85CAD+? No.",Toronto Pearson Airport,3.0,4,4,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,no
British Airways,Poor wifi lazy staff and pokey lounge. Front desk ran out of buffet tickets for business class diners and just generally feels badly organized. I did a speed test on the wi-fi and it was <1 mb/s. lounge is shared with AA but really can't accommodate many people at all. Some nice armchairs in first area but otherwise cramped and uncomfortable. I fly out out here often and it's just not good enough for BA.,Philadelphia Airport,2.0,2,3,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no
British Airways,I visited this lounge at the end of a wonderful trip to the Niagara Falls area for a family reunion flying in and out of Toronto from London. Part of the enjoyment was travelling in business class (Club World) and on the return trip I had several hours to enjoy the Lounge before the night flight. What made it special for me was the very kind and attentive manager Tony (I don't have his surname). And it wasn't just Tony as all the staff were very nice and welcoming. They are good ambassadors for BA!,Toronto Pearson Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,Thought we'd try the lounge as it was yards away from departure gate. What a pleasant surprise. Quiet and peaceful and away from the crowds in the mail lounge. I think it's even better than First!,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,5,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,I found this lounge great for relaxing and unwinding as only British Airways first class passengers are allowed in. Unless you have your 5000 frequent flier tier points to get a Concorde Room Card all gold and silver card holders use the galleries lounges meaning this one is much more quiet and peaceful. Staff did a good job keeping the lounge clean but sometimes this meant that they took a bit too much time to fulfill passenger's requests. Although they definetly did not outdo themselves in terms of the restroom/shower quality they did a good job with it and I found each well kept. Business center had pretty fast Internet and wifi worked well. Although the food options offered were all very tasty one thing I disliked about this lounge was that those options were pretty limited and other than a few main course choices there were only light snacks available upon request. Overall I think Britsh Airways took a good risk by not making this lounge extremely large and instea d putting their focus on the quality of the area and I would definetly visit again and recommend it to others.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,The only downside to this lounge is that it doesn't open until 4pm for the evening flights (I am not sure if it is open in the morning for the morning flight out of JFK) so if you have a long layover chances are you will have to spend some time in the Galleries First and Terraces Lounges which are nice but don't touch the quality of this lounge. A very tranquil and peaceful area British Airways has made sure there are almost too many staff members so that while food is prepared the lounge is cleaned etc. there are also staff available to help with anything you need. When dinner is available the quality and choice of food is fantastic and there is a wide selection of snacks available upon request when in search of something lighter. The wifi works well and there are also 3 computers in the back. A small quiet room that could easily be missed provides a nice place to relax. The only negative to this lounge is that the spa/shower rooms are not in the Lou ge so to take a shower I had to walk across the terminal and into the Business class lounge but it's a small terminal so it's not that bad. Overall this has to be one of my favorite lounges in the world and I actually prefer it over the Concorde room at London Heathrow.,New York JFK Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,The aesthetics of the lounge are very pleasing the food and service levels are dismal. Food is served under hot lamps but unfortunately they don't do their work food is cold. Attempting to speak to staff made no difference. British Airways are expensive customers who part with well earned cash deserve an above average experience. This wasn't average it was dismal.,London Heathrow Airport,2.0,4,3,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Very poor. The quality and choice of the food has gone downhill. They must be on an economy drive or changed supplier as the difference has been very noticeable. BA are falling behind in the premium class. I'm writing this in the lounge on the world's slowest Internet connection too!,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,4,4,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,no
British Airways,First time flying in First through T5 and huge disappointment with the Concorde Lounge - no dedicated security checks means you stand in a queue for 30 minutes. Lounge is small and cramped - staff poorly trained and clearly have no natural customer service flair. Restaurant booths were full when we were there - staff were unhelpful and no booking system meaning you need to go back over and again to find space (in the end we went to the Gordon Ramsey opposite the lounge). Orders not fulfilled in the bar area or the 'terrace'. Carpets stained and the whole room looking tired. Elmis spa has no dedicated area for First in fact we couldn't get in - as priority is 'first come' rather than First then Business. Overall don't use this lounge and T5 as any kind of reason to fly British Airways!,London Heathrow Airport,2.0,2,1,2.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Having visited the BA First lounges at JFK and LGW and being disappointed I was very surprised how good the lounge was. Lots of space and natural light and good food and drink choice. The Mrs and I had made to order food as well as helping ourselves to the hot buffet and cakes we felt very spoilt. Nice champagne only let down was the Johnny Walker Blue available at LGW was missing.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,"31 May 2013 afternoon and evening usage due to a long layover. The lounge space is quite nice and functions reasonably well despite lacking shower facilities. The glass tube shaped terminal building offers nice tarmac views from this lounge. The food service is merely average most of the day but the beverage service is quite good. A dinner buffet was served much too late for the ""Sleeper Service"" flight. BA does this to exclude the CX customers who share the lounge but it gives BA passengers only about an hour prior to boarding leaving very little time for flexibility. Lounge front counter staff members were outstanding and went out of their way to make me feel welcome. Overall one of the nicer BA lounges though not quite as well equipped as their lounges at LHR T5.",Dubai Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,Very small lounge for the size of airport and became very busy toward departure time of mid afternoon flight. Very attentive reception staff. Food on offer at approximately 1400 hrs was fine (sandwich selection pastries soup biscuits crisps nuts etc). Lounge staff cleared and cleaned up efficiently. This lounge just needs to be extended as it is too small. Close to gates 10 +11 for the LHR flights and boarding calls made timely.,Edinburgh Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,Good welcome. Despite being busy plenty of seating - either for sitting at table to eat or just sitting. Great selection of food which was frequently refreshed. Clear up service of used plates and mugs somewhat slow. Great viewing of planes landing. Toilet facilities clean and sufficient.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,Very disappointed in the Concorde Room. The dining staff seemed almost irritated that we wanted breakfast. Scrambled eggs were cold. I'm still waiting for the second cup of coffee I requested. Very pleasant seating outside in the terrace area but so difficult to catch the attention of the staff. I eventually went up to the bar myself but the one guy was busy filling orders for the waitresses and I had to wait to catch his attention. I saw no food except for the food served in the dining area. Next time we will go to the Galleries Lounge and help ourselves.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,4,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,no
British Airways,The BA lounge at Warsaw airport is located after Immigration control on the lower level. A fairly quiet lounge with hot and cold drinks available but a poor selection of snacks. Crisps and nuts seem to make up BA's choice of food in Warsaw although a few stale bread rolls were available with cheese. The lounge offers a basic product.,Warsaw Chopin Airport,3.0,3,4,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,no
British Airways,Late morning flight to Heathrow. I found the lounge relatively easily. Warm welcome limited flight information in the lounge but flight was called in plenty of time (40 minutes prior) and boarding had only just started when we arrived. Travelling to the gate (G12) involved using a shuttle/train so it is worth giving yourself plenty of time. Lounge very spacious. Newspapers available but no English language magazines. Food limited but - too late for breakfast and too early for lunch. Catering consisted of crisps nuts fruit and a few pastries. Coffee machine broken. Beer on tap but another passenger commented that the barrel needed to be changed. Plenty of alcohol available including prosecco. Luggage storage space available. Toilets decent and within lounge.,Rome Fiumicino Airport,3.0,4,4,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,Mid morning flight to Rome a reasonably warm welcome at the front desk. Decent selection of newspapers and magazines. The lounge was very busy and it was a struggle to find 2 seats in particular ones surrounded by used glasses plates and cups. Wi-fi was difficult to connect to although more the fault of myself and my iPad. Password readily displayed and there is a a guide in the lounge for iPad users. Champagne available on request and (unusually) freely available in the bar area. Selection of basic breakfast items juices and snacks. There is very limited hot food available in this lounge. Toilets very clean.,London Gatwick Airport,3.0,4,4,5.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,"We had some difficulty finding this lounge; on our first attempt at following the ""VIP"" signs we ended up at a different lounge where we could have stayed but we were advised that there was another lounge much closer to our gate which was in fact the case. It's a comfortable lounge and it didn't seem too busy even on a Friday evening. There are different types of seating including desks and tables as well as a lot of very comfortable armchairs. There is a very nice rest area which is kept in semi- darkness with beds where you can take a nap. There are plenty of drinks available including wines spirits coffee and various soft drinks. The food is a little disappointing consisting of a small range of sandwiches (a fresh batch was delivered while we were there and they seemed quite freshly made) and various other snacks. Nothing more substantial is available. There seems to be no more than 15 minutes of free wifi available which is rather disappointing for a business lounge. Together with the poor signage towards the lounge and the obvious lack of airport staff in general for the first- time visitor this lounge gets an average score from us. If you know where it is already then you may find it better. We did enjoy the chance to relax for a couple of hours before our departure though.",Barcelona Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,yes
British Airways,The lounge is a bit tired and Wi-Fi access is via a password at the reception area. In terms of refreshments the lounge has to be the worst I have ever experienced. Snacks were just about it and they were few and far between. There was a large basket of biscuit for cheese but no cheese on offer. When I enquired about this at reception I was curtly told “we offer sandwiches from 3pm. That's it!” I entered the lounge at 12:30pm. Some beer spirits and wine were available but not a great selection. There are no toilets in the lounge so to go you have to take everything with you and it's a trek!,Berlin Tegel Airport,2.0,3,3,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
British Airways,What a disappointment. Canteen style food. Food served in metal canteen holders were a fitting receptacle for clumps of penne pasta and tomato sauce. Cheese served in the same metal container chunks of cheddar and indifferent blue. No wonder the majority were feasting on Kettle Chips as the only fresh oasis in a sea of processed food. We were tempted to slip next door to the One where we knew we could order a fresh cooked snack before boarding but instead we are hopeful that the food on board may be better and therefore we will maintain our appetites. Shame on BA for not show casing the Best of British fare when passengers are leaving the UK.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,2,3,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
British Airways,As a Qantas Club member my wife two young children and I were refused entry as our children were counted as guests. A few days earlier we were allowed entry to the BA lounge in Vancouver and we have never had problems with Qantas lounges. BA's policy here is unfair to families travelling with kids. To make matters worse I raised the issue with the 'manager' and experienced appalling customer service bordering on vindictiveness.,London Heathrow Airport,3.4,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,no
British Airways,Not very well signposted to the location of the lounge I just happened to look left at the correct time! Excellent lounge though! Reception is staffed is by informative and jolly staff. As the lounge is only used by a handful of flights each day it is quiet and you can easily find yourself in a nice corner with a couple of tables and chairs to spread out. Full selection of wines spirits and beers were on offer with Peroni on draft which is a great addition to any airline lounge. Hot drinks machine was working. A good range of food was on offer with an assortment of finger sandwiches that weren't dry or tasteless. Nice little pasta pots also added a twist to the offerings. A good selection pastries. In terms of comfort the seating was good. The furnishings and little details gave it the signature British Airways lounge feel. Lack of departures screen can make you slightly anxious that you'll see your plane trundle past as you are fully reclined at one of the window seats. But the receptionist insists she will call the flight for you but being British we need to see it to believe it - by using the free Wi-Fi in the lounge keeping an eye on your flights status is possible. Overall a fantastic terraces lounge outside of the UK. Much larger than required but not going to complain! Food on offer left me content and drinks on offer were of expected quality.,Rome Fiumicino Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,Visited this lounge on a late Monday afternoon. There were very few people in the lounge when we arrived so no problems finding a comfortable seat. The choice of food was very limited and the same as every time we use this lounge The only hot option was soup which although very good surely should not be the only choice in the middle of winter. Other options were salads cold pasta dish and sandwiches (which were beginning to curl at the edges!) The drinks available were as usual excellent with good wines good choice of spirits and non alcoholic beverages The staff were helpful and friendly. The only thing that lets this premium lounge down is the uninspired food choice.,London Gatwick Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,There's almost nothing after customs except the BA Lounge. Great range of drinks and wines. Cheese and biscuits and a small range of sandwiches and wraps. No outside windows and quite small. Warm welcome. Comfortable seating.,Bermuda Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,It's a trip up a few escalators at the end of the Terminal 5 departure lounge. Once you are finally there it is a quiet and spacious haven with varous zones - you can use the internet relax on a sofa or at a table. There are various points for coffee and tea wines and spirits as well as a nice food area. For me it was morning and there was a selection of bacon rolls other hot breakfast items yoghurt sliced fresh fruits and juices. The washrooms were clean and shower facilites were also available. There is a similar lounge close to security but that is planned mainly for domestic/european passengers. The one at the far end of T5 is better.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,Visited the BA Lounge Galleries South lounge in T5A prior to a long haul flight to Asia. Very welcoming staff on the front desk. Good selection of newspapers and magazines available. Decent wi-fi which permitted streaming. The cinema area is a good place to relax. Basic but filling selection of hot food available including cous cous pasta and jacket potatoes with various fillings. Good selection of wines available. Attentive staff seemed to be working in the lounge and lounge was kept clean and tidy. Only minor criticism is that on my several recent visits to this lounge it has been very busy or seemingly near capacity with trouble getting a seat anywhere near the buffet area or the sofa area that overlooks the main concourse and the coffee is of vending machine standard. Otherwise this is a very good facility.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,Easy to find. Pleasant welcome. Comfortable seating and good view of airport. Varied and tasteful food. Direct access from the lounge to the plane. Just what a lounge should be.,San Francisco Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,Arrived at about 11am and the bacon and rolls were thankfully still available. Crowded when we first went in the lounge cleared toward midday. Bacon et al replaced by pastries and fruit.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,3,4,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,yes

British Airways,Compared to other BA lounges in the UK and abroad this one really sucks. The location is good as the lounge is circular overlooking the main airside lounge and with runway views. The seating was tired and food was almost non existant. We had a midmorning transatlantic flight with American (booked through BA) and there was no evidence of the bacon rolls and other delights we are used to in Terminal 5. Toilets were in poor condition and the staff were lacklustre to say the least.,Manchester Airport,2.0,2,2,3.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Used the Concorde Room in the run up to the Olympics and the height of the school holidays but it wasn't over crowded. I booked a cabana which has a day bed tv free telephone writing desk bathroom and the option to order room service. The staff regularly walked around taking orders from passengers and were delivered efficiently and with a smile. The lounge was also cleared of any glasses plates etc and was kept very tidy. The spa treatment was also very good but you need to book in advance to be sure of a treatment. The food choices were excellent for both lunch and dinner accompanied by a selection of vintage champagnes and fine wines.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,Great breakfast excellent service. However no massage slots available and sneered at for not booking in advance although never received any information or suggestion to do so. Was never required on previous flights to/from NY. Was spoken to as though I was a complete idiot for not booking before arriving and this was 3 hours before my flight.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,5,3,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,Very small with no privacy. Close to gate so you can sit and watch plane being loaded. Poor selection of food and drink. Some strange sandwich fillings so ended up with a bag of crisps. WI-fi very slow. Toilets only had 2 cubicles to share with club lounge. Disappointing.,Vancouver Airport,3.0,4,4,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,no
British Airways,Bright airy great views. Quite busy for 6.15 on Sunday morning but I guess there were a lot of passengers having arrived fro the US Far East and Australia. Lots of seating and quite varied seating from armchairs to bar stools. Staff exceptionally friendly. Food OK but plentiful. Could do with a few more sockets for charging iPhones etc. Overall a very good experience.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,Pleasant enough lounge. Separate area for those who want to watch TV. Not a great selection of drinks food adequate. Plenty of power points.

British Airways,The First Class lounge looks attractive and seemed classier than the Club lounge next door. The choice of drinks was reasonable with decent champagne but the quality of whiskey was rather low for a First class lounge. I used the showers in the Business Class lounge next door it was okay but I have certainly had better experiences. The real serious disappointment was the choice of food there were some cold sandwiches and packets of cheap cheese and a variety of crisps etc but nothing hot - a real let down.,New York JFK Airport,3.0,4,4,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
British Airways,There appear to be two lounges at Prague. The Crystal and another The Citigold which is supposed to be the better option. Considering the rest of the Airport which is spacious clean and serviceable the lounges were quite frankly awful. We had travelled BA Club Europe and were given passes to the Crystal Lounge. This offered a coffee machine and some nuts and limited seating. We then tried the Citigold as we have gold cards and this was not a lot better. They offered a fridge with some rather dry rolls and an assortment of cold salad pasta in individual pots. A plate of broken biscuits and solf drinks. The carpets looked pretty filthy and I was quite glad to get out of there Free wi-fi was available but we would probably have been better down at KFC in the main hall.,Prague Airport,2.0,2,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,no

British Airways,Design is good plenty of different areas and types of seating excellent selection of beverages and good selection of food although not outstanding. Staff clear tables very quickly after passengers leave and are very helpful. A very comfortable experience overall - could possibly be improved by an area for sleeping.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,I spent about 8 hours in the lounge complex at Heathrow T5 and was impressed about the constant changes of food throughout the day. I used the north south and satellite lounges and they had variations on the menus. The north and satellite lounges do have manned cloakrooms to store belongings whereas the south lounge you leave items at your own risk. The lounges were kept clean and tidy despite the constant churn of passenger use. If you are looking for peace and quiet the satellite terminal is the quietest and if you require champagne it is upon request. Shower and bathroom facilities were also very good and kept clean. Wifi is free and plenty of computers to use. A most enjoyable way to start a trip.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,In the North wing of T5. It is huge although on a Sunday morning plenty of the seat were occupied. Usual fare - nosh a bit ordinary. Seat so-so on comfort. All a bit so so really.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,3,5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,yes
British Airways,"I was travelling on the daily BA flight to London we hit the lounge fairly early and there was nothing much to show in the way of snacks etc. In a conspiratorial voice we were told to tell the bar staff that we were flying with BA and so would not be charged for drinks and so forth (the prices for AA Passengers were ridiculous). We were also told that ""hot food"" would be available when the last AA flight departed. This proved to be soup and a tray of sandwiches some crudities and a dip. Seating was comfortable and staff were efficient and very helpful. Good views of the runway and ramps from the bar area. There were no showers and the bathrooms were not very modern and the fittings were in need of a makeover.",San Diego Airport,3.0,5,5,5.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,This is a rabbit warren to get around in. Reasonable to navigate around if you have a sense of direction and you can get your bearings. Good food and beverage range with attentive staff. Definitely no comparison to Qantas First Lounge at Sydney International but I imagine there aren't too many that would.,Miami Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,"When you present your First Class Boarding Passes to the First Reception Desk and are told ""you need to go over there"" (Club World Lounge) and you have to point out that you are a First Class passenger things do not bode well. The Lounge is okay but Champagne Bar doesn't keep the champagne chilled adequately. First Class dining room has quite a limited menu and isn't great. 6 months ago when I travelled First Class out of London we were invited to experience the dining room and presented an invitation to dine after a certain time. This practice has now gone - pity. In fact the hot self serve buffet had a better food choice than the dining area. Overall the First Class Lounge was okay but not great.",London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,yes
British Airways,We arrived at the Lounge to be greeted by 4 friendly staff and encouraged to enter and relax. When we entered there were the best part of 150 people in it. We struggled to get the last two seats. We found out that they had closed the Business Class Lounge and put everyone into the First Class Lounge just to make us feel special I guess. Uncomfortable seating self serve basic buffet poor food and beverage to say the least. When we encountered a delay the staff were hopeless. Either inexperienced or incorrectly trained they could not cope or handle high yield passengers appropriately or properly. Choose another airport to transit with a better First Class Lounge.,Singapore Changi Airport,2.0,1,3,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,no
British Airways,This is probably the best Business Class Lounge that I have experienced. Bright refreshing and well equipped. Spacious and well fitted out. Enjoyable.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,Excellent lounge with plenty of everything. Used it twice recently and it was quiet well-stocked with drinks food and papers and with plenty of room. Highly recommended.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,British Airways share the Qantas lounge located near the gates which is nice. Welcome was friendly and staff attentive. Food selection is much better than in LHR and nice interesting choices. Lounge is quite spacious even though both BA flights and a Qantas flight were leaving at the same time. There are no views as the lounge is not near the windows of the airport. Showers are nice great water pressure and they use nice toiletries. Staff friendly and gave a small amenity kit. WiFi was strong and quick and the lounge was a serene place to relax.,Hong Kong Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,A quiet and relaxed lounge with comfortable seating and superb views of the runways. There are facilities to leave bags and coats and private dining booths for breakfast and lunch. Food and drink is waiter service. Although afternoon tea does not feature on any menu the staff were more than happy to serve this for me. I used one of the cabanas where you have a day bed desk TV phone for free use and luxury bathroom facilities. You can order room service from your cabana. The Elemis Spa is located just outside the lounge but book a treatment early to avoid disappointment. For me using this lounge is part of my holiday before a long haul flight.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,This was an exceptionally nice lounge albeit small for 2 flights departing close together. For the next year plus it is also to serve as the Admiral's Club for AA Needless to say it has gone from a little haven of peace to a typical US lounge facility. British Airways passengers and the staff clearly hate the situation.,Philadelphia Airport,4.0,3,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,This lounge shared between BA Iberia and American was spacious but laid out in a series of small rooms with a variety of seating options. On the day we were there it was not overcrowded. A good selection of drinks available the attended counter being closed. Food was pretty poor with only a few stale looking croissant sandwiches and soup on offer. The flight announcements were barely audible where we were seated and I had to go and check with the reception that it had indeed been our flight which had been called. Wi-fi and computer availability were good. Unfortunately the arrivals and departure screens only dealt with AA flights.,Miami Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,yes
British Airways,Spacious lounge with comfortable and quiet seating areas. The selection of food and beverage is excellent though service when ordering from the menu is slow. Many computer terminals and helpful staff at the inner Customer Service desk. The decorative glass screens between seating areas are lovely when lit if dark outside. The lounge location benefits from nice views of the tarmac and taxiways. The showers and Elemis Health Spa are located outside the lounge and shared with the Galleries Business Class Lounge that is located above.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,5,4,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,Without a doubt the most miserable business lounge on this planet. Having travelled from London and using the fantastic BA lounge I had the misfortune to land in LA and through a reciprocal arrangement with BA I used the American Airlines Admirals Club lounge. It's a joke - you pay for almost everything the only free stuff consists of things like lukewarm and stewed instant coffee stale biscuits and a few bruised pieces of fruit. You get one drink voucher and no wifi access unless you are a member. Suggest you give this place and American Airlines a wide berth! Unfortunately my next leg is with American Airlines and no surprises you have to pay for in flight coffee and food! I will never fly with budget airline American Airlines again!,Los Angeles Lax Airport,1.0,2,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,no
British Airways,I was frankly very disappointed. Only half of the food on the bar menu was available and someone did tell me about other food options that were apparently available but they mumbled so much I have no clue as to what they said - at the third time of asking I gave up.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,3,4,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,no
British Airways,At the bag drop in Terminal 5 the British Airways staff member let me know that the Galleries North lounge would be much closer to my flight's departure gate than the South lounge. I had not used the North lounge before and went along there assuming it would be the same as the South lounge. In fact it was much less enjoyable. The North lounge is significantly smaller and was extremely crowded with almost all the seats taken. It was noisy hot and felt congested with passenger's carry-on bags filling the walkspace. The food selection was similar to the South lounge but the range of magazines available was very limited. Next time I will know to go straight to the South lounge whichever gate my flight leaves from and just leave the extra time to walk up to the gates at the north of the terminal.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,2,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
British Airways,Fairly large lounge visited on a Sunday evening. Standard Terraces comfortable recently updated free wi-fi. The staff are friendly and efficient at clearing tables and ensuring the limited offerings are kept up to date. Only one red and one white wine small selection of spirits and the food is only light snacks but what there is is of a good quality nice tartlets mini sandwiches etc). Overall a good experience it is a nice place to wait for a flight.,Geneva Airport,4.0,5,5,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
British Airways,This is a newly refurbished lounge modelled on the Concorde Room at LHR. Very comfortable and plenty of space as this lounge is for exclusive use of BA passengers only travelling in First. The food and beverages were of high quality and a dining area if you wished to use it. The wifi was a bit slow so gave up in the end. The spa facilities are upstairs in the Terraces lounge and so are shower facilities.,New York JFK Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,no
British Airways,A great lounge with plenty of high quality and comfortable seating. The dining options are extensive and there is also an extensive range of drinks to choose from. The private cabanas are good to use as you have more seclusion from the rest of the lounge and have your own bathroom day bed TV writing desk and you can order room service too. There is also a telephone in the room where you can phone for free anywhere in the world. The Boardroom has free computers and a printer and the seats are original Concorde chairs. There are secure storage facilities for your belongings and clean bathroom facilities.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
British Airways,The only hot food available were plastic containers of Two-Minute Noodles. Alcohol is served from a bar which is not always tended - you have to ring a bell and wait. The only other food is packets of crisps crackers cheese. The windows are blocked off by translucent blinds making it rather claustrophobic.,Seattle Airport,3.0,3,4,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no
British Airways,The Concorde Room really has lost its exclusive feel. It was very crowded and from the destinations people were travelling too full of passengers not travelling in First - it is supposed to be only for First passengers according to the BA hype. The staff spent much time discussing their work issues loudly in full hearing of the passengers. Staff do not actively patrol to see if anyone needs anything which is odd since nothing on offer is available self-service. Food service was O.K. but not very professional and the presentation on the plate would be fine for a transport caff. The whole deal falls short of what one expects of true first class service but of course that is typical of the whole experience on BA.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,4,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,no
Delta Air Lines,"SkyClub in Seattle was bright and spacious with clean well stocked bathrooms. Seating comfortable with excellent views of the apron. Front desk staff helpful and friendly. Food and beverage options are a lot better than United and American with some tasty soup, salad, bread and your usual snack options. My only gripe is the fact that they had disposable plates and utensils which is not classy at all. Service was decent, lounge staff were a bit timid for some reason. WiFi connection was fast which is always great. Overall, a decent lounge and DL definitely leads among the major US legacies when it comes to lounge food.",Seattle Airport,9.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,The Sydney Qantas First Lounge could quite possibly be the best first class lounge on the planet. Great menu premium restaurant style food cooked to order and service excellent. Drink menu and the spa are something else. If your into aviation and like seeing the air field activity and the planes coming and going the view is spectacular. Staff very attentive and the meals papers and Internet service excellent. I've travelled a bit First class and this lounge is the new standard. Five star comfort. Didn't really want to get on the plane.,Sydney Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
British Airways,The first class lounge in Houston is pathetic no showers and no food whatsoever except crisps and pre packed biscuits also no champagne. How can they call this First Class I don't know! Business Class lounge is better as they did have a few rather dried up sandwiches.,Houston Hobby Airport,2.0,3,4,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,no
Delta Air Lines,The business class lounge at the new Delta terminal at JFK is very disappointing. Poor layout meager offerings in the way of snacks and/or drinks overcrowded and a very poor set up when wanting to order a paid meal. It's very difficult and unclear as to know how to order food/drinks. Instructions at the tables are vague order placement terminals poorly placed and in general a bewildering experience. The seating is comfortable clean with good choices of seating areas. Lighting is comfortable Rest rooms are clean.,New York JFK Airport,3.0,2,5,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no
Delta Air Lines,Bought a day pass as this is the only lounge at IND. While rather small it never seems over crowded. It has been kept clean and is an oasis of calm. For a domestic lounge Delta has really stepped up it's game on food offerings with a hot soup green and other salads flat breads and the usual raw veggies and packaged cheeses that used to be it. There is no view and no announcements so you need to keep your wit's about you especially if you are travelling on another airline. A variety of seating but no high tech massage chairs. Overall I was impressed.,Unknown,4.0,5,4,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Delta Air Lines,"Large pleasantly appointed lounge on two levels with extensive views of the apron and one runway. A two teir bar system operates in the lounge the majority of drinks are free but items from the ""Luxury Bar"" ie. non domestic and premium spirits incur a charge. It was therefore possible to sit and drink Jack Daniels all day but if you wanted named Scotch bacardi and so forth you pay. Draft and bottle beers soft drinks and mixers are all free. We were in the lounge from 3 to 5pm and there was plenty of seating available staff were pleasant and efficient. Food was basic; crudities with dips two types of soup pre-packed rubber cheese and a delicious curried cous cous. OK it was basic but everything looked fresh and they kept it well stocked up. Showers were excellent with a good supply of the basic things you need for your grooming on offer before you enter and soap shampoo conditioner and towels ready in the shower area. Overall as good as most European lounges and better than many US ones.",Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,4.0,4,5,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,Not much in the way of sandwiches or snacks on display but there were some cookies and a modest bar selection. The pre-flight dinner in a private dining area (across the hall actually in the Business Lounge) was excellent with a nice salad and well-prepared entree and a choice of excellent dessert. Nice choice of wines as well. The First lounge itself is actually rather small and feels a bit cramped - very pleasant staff however who let us know that our flight was boarding and were apologetic about the half-hour delay.,Chicago O'Hare Airport,4.0,3,5,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
British Airways,Huge lounge lots of people but no sense of being crowded. Superb selection of liquor including Grey Goose and other premium brands nice wine selection as well. Fairly extensive selection of snacks of all kinds - some of the sandwiches were superb. Huge area with many computer work stations with good high speed internet service.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
British Airways,Lounge operated by Qantas. Quieter than Business Class Lounge but the food selection was disappointing especially compared to Cathay Pacific. Wireless access was provided by the airport and it was difficult to connect. I don't think this lounge matches the standards of the First Class lounges operated by Cathay Pacific and British Airways.,Hong Kong Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
Delta Air Lines,The worst SkyTeam lounge I have ever visited. Ridiculously scarce collection of food and drinks. Another disappointing thing is that the personnel in the Santiago lounge did not care about how bad the service and presentation were. I do not even think that they were trained in the customer service. Shame on Delta!,Santiago De Chile Airport,2.0,1,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,no
Delta Air Lines,One word to describe this lounge - horrendous. The lounge is ridiculously small with some people left standing while waiting for seats to become free. The seats themselves are worn and in some cases dirty. Some of the staff were friendly some less so. No hot food and not much cold food either. Delta should be ashamed. While US airline lounges don't compare with those of the European or Asian carriers Delta's Sky Clubs are the worst. My recent experience has shown that Admirals Clubs while not perfect are infinitely superior to Delta's. I like the Delta product in the air but my experience in their clubs has made me seriously consider changing allegiance to American.,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,2.0,1,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,no
Delta Air Lines,I travel frequently and this is one of the worse lounges I have been in. At check in the person in charge was on the phone and I had to wait for 10 minutes. The bar was fine but the bathrooms were appalling. I ended up going to the public bathroom in the terminal. No only the design is bad (3 cubicles about 5 feet tall) but the sinks were dirty the 3 paper towel machines were empty and there was trash on the floor. Who killed customer service and the glamour of travel?,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,2.0,2,1,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Although this lounge is modelled on the First Galleries at T5 it does not live up the service and quality of the Concorde Room. However it is a quieter lounge as the BA flights departing from here leave late in the evening so it's not an issue to book a spa treatment. The menu choices were uninspiring and no afternoon tea served. Pre-flight dining however was much better.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no
British Airways,T5 galleries super for relaxing or working well designed seating areas. Newspapers & magazines in various locations internet computers fax and copiers.

British Airways,The lounge was spotless and I was greeted warmly by the man behind the desk even though I wasn't travelling with BA and had entered the lounge via Priority Pass. The toilets were clean bar soft drinks and food was all well stocked and the papers and magazines were all current. There's a TV and a monitor displaying flight times. The man in the lounge was so helpful he even let us know when our non BA flight was boarding!,Jersey Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no

Delta Air Lines,Absolute con- just meant to make money off economy class passengers who are led to believe they are paying for luxury. The worst airline lounge I have ever been to. They charge business class passengers for drinks at the 'luxury bar' at Atlanta and it was the worst Bloody Mary I ever had - always thought they was a safe choice. The seats at Chicago were uncomfortable. The lounges were dirty. I will never take a codeshare flight where Delta is a partner. I am worried that they will now destroy the Virgin lounges considering the fact that they own most of Virgin.,Chicago O'Hare Airport,2.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,no
Delta Air Lines,This is a contract lounge shared with several airlines including Delta. I was not permitted to invite a guest although I was flying business class and hold a crown Room membership. This is one of the worst international business class lounges - seating is poor - very few tables (I needed to use the floor to place my beverage as there was no table available). Food and drink selection is poor.,Rome Fiumicino Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,no
British Airways,I went back to this lounge and was surprised to find that they are transforming the outdated Terraces Lounge into a new Galleries lounge similar to ones at Heathrow airport. The selection of hot food remains poor with only soup available but there was the same selection of cold food and drinks. The lounge was extremely busy but there was enough room.,London Gatwick Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
British Airways,Once passed security there are two lounges. Tip provided to me by the reception was use the lounge by Gate30 as it has only 9% occupancy. Took the advice and wandered in to a haven of peace and quiet. The food/drink selection was good. Staff were polite and helpful where required.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
British Airways,Very small lounge but well staffed and stocked. There was no aircon however which made it very uncomfortable on a day when it soared to 36 celsius. Mobile phones must be switched off. Ricard was the only spirit on offer.,Toulouse Airport,3.0,2,3,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,no
Delta Air Lines,Not a large lounge and with a limited selection of free snacks and drinks (there is also a bar) but clean and quiet. Located in Terminal S from which most (but not all) Delta flights depart. Our flight departed from another terminal so we had to take an elevator down to the terminal level then another (or escalator) down to a train to take us to our terminal.,Seattle Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,yes
Delta Air Lines,JFK Skyclub lounge is so disappointing after experiencing KLM's in Amsterdam. In Amsterdam you get great food snacks: good breads and cheeses croissants etc. At JFK it's basically just drinks and things that go with drinks as if no one wants to eat anything but carrot sticks and olives. I was upgraded on my next flight from JFK to DTW at dinner time and on that flight in FIRST CLASS there was just a basket of junk food of the kind you'd get at a 7/11. Delta seems to think all people want are drinks. I'm Gold Medallion and was glad for the privilege of the Skyclub lounge in Amsterdam (KLM's) but Delta in JFK (and I imagine elsewhere) is much inferior.,New York JFK Airport,3.0,4,4,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
Delta Air Lines,First time we used the rather new (remodeled) lounge in the international terminal (F). Large comfortable. Plenty of showers. Outdoor patio appended to the main lounge area was nice.

British Airways,This lounge has no windows. It comprises three or four box like rooms including the dining room. The lounge is comfortable and well supplied with drinks and biscuits. The selection of sandwiches was poor two choices plus a wrap of some sort. The pre flight dinner which BA offers for overnight flights to London was cold or lukewarm. Hardly surprising when the chef spent most of his time on the internet in the business section of the lounge instead of in the kitchen! The exception was the excellent sweetcorn chowder of which I had two bowls as the rest of the food was stale and uninviting. Not a patch on the preflight dinner I enjoyed a couple of years ago at JFK. I don't know if this is yet another sign of the diminishing standards with BA or just a lazy chef. No showers either. The rest of the staff were very helpful and gave good service.,Chicago O'Hare Airport,3.0,4,4,4.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,no
British Airways,Large and airy lounge with plenty space which is needed at busier times as gets fairly congested! Good selection papers magazines etc. Food readily available and plenty of it!

Delta Air Lines,As a very frequent flyer my wife and I think that this is the worst lounge we have ever been in. The staff on front desk surly and totally not interested in their customers who pay their wages they need to be reminded food options non existent. Coffee machine broken not in use . I think Delta need to look around and maybe visit their Atlanta lounge. All in all a very bad advertisement.,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,1.0,1,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no
Delta Air Lines,This lounge is used by SkyTeam airlines here at Narita and what a poor reflection on SkyTeam as an airline alliance. Why is it that airline lounges operate by US carriers offer such second rate standards with this Delta lounge being cheap overcrowded and very dirty by Japanese standards? The breakfast offering food-wise is quite pitiful some cereals yogurt and low quality pastries - is this what I get when flying First Class with a SkyTeam airline? Washrooms were dirty the showers at best a 2-Star standard. In other words this is a lounge to avoid if you are used to the higher standards normally found in Asia and Japan. My last trip out of Narita was with ANA and the ANA Suite lounges are so so superior to the poor standards that US airlines such as Delta provide.,Tokyo Narita Airport,2.0,2,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,no
Delta Air Lines,This is a joke lounge it's really like sports bar. I had to pay for everything nothing was free apart from nuts and carrots. I had prosecco and sushi which was very wrong - really hard rise huge sushi.. Came up $36. I should have just hang out at the gate as it was so far away to get there couldn't be bother to go back again.,New York JFK Airport,2.0,2,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Worse than any other lounge ever experienced regardless of class of travel! To be fair airport undergoing renovations at time but that did not excuse the poor quality and availability of decent edible food! Poor selection of drinks and lacklustre service. Worst of all the air conditioning was not working and felt like being in a sauna for an hour before flight took off. Avoid like the plague!,Los Angeles Lax Airport,2.0,1,3,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,no
British Airways,Calm environment in which to relax pre/post flight. Tastefully decorated and plenty of quiet spaces where it is possible to gain some privacy from others. Good cabanas to refresh and catch up on some sleep between flights. Full dining facilities enable one to get maximum sleep on board if overnight flight. Plenty of decent Champagne too! A proper first class facility if only this could be transposed onboard!,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,3,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Delta Air Lines,I have spent many hours in the SEA Skyclub the last few months. Recently Delta has been testing new food offerings here including soup cold sandwiches and hot and cold appetizers. The soup and sandwiches are a welcome addition and might quiet some of the criticism in these comments. Other criticisms have been the presence of children in some of the delta clubs. Personally I found the children refreshing and much more interesting than the folk that typically populate the clubs. Delta has solved that problem too as they will soon begin to charge $29 per guest including family members unless you purchase a $700 executive membership. The SEA club has a great staff especially the bartenders. The complementary alcohol though is poor quality and the Luxury Bar drinks are not cheap. The seating in this club is generally uncomfortable except for the quiet room. This lounge needs additional electric outlets in the seating areas. There is only one shower but usually not a wait for it. Wifi is always good.,Seattle Airport,4.0,3,3,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Delta Air Lines,Decent quiet reliable lounge. Was able to have a relaxing wait at SeaTac before my recent flight to CDG. Like most US airline lounges the food was basic and unadventurous but there were just enough satisfying items (among them some good soups that I actually had several helpings of). No showers in the bathroom I think but the washrooms were clean.,Seattle Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,One of a group of lounges in Terminal D all operated by one company but with separate identities and side by side. Pleasant helpful staff and plenty of drinks and nibbles. The concierge announced that new sandwiches had arrived! First lounge is off the Business. Just one male and one female loo and a small business centre. Plenty of newspapers. Compared with the nearby Admiral's Club an oasis of calm and style.,Unknown,4.0,3,4,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
British Airways,This Galleries lounge is very similar to the ones in T5 although it is much smaller. They have the same choice of food and drinks and similar facilities. It is extremely quite due to the small number of BA flights out of T3 and the downside is the lack of natural light (the windows are quite narrow) and the lack of atmosphere. Even the BA staff looked bored and not very welcoming.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,3,4,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
British Airways,Very impressive from the welcome at the door to every member of the staff encountered. Lovely ambience with a lot of room to move around. Took lunch in the Dining Room which was the only disappointment.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Delta Air Lines,Lounge was somewhat of a joke. Interior definitely done on the cheap. Food consisted of crackers and some mystery dip. Room not clean with tables that had not been picked up by employees for some time. Annoying children with parents who think the room is a play ground. My wife and I left after 15 minutes shaking our heads in disgust. We would rather wait at the gate at this airport.,Salt Lake City Airport,2.0,1,1,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no
Delta Air Lines,No food but crackers and carrots this is terrible I guess we are all to eat like rabbits and drink like fish? They use to be good with hot snacks bread and other finger foods. This frustrating when the cost of the flights went up a lot and the service went way down. This last time my company with book with Delta business class and we are platinum members.,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,3.0,4,4,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
Delta Air Lines,Had to pay 50 dollars despite having a first class ticket as flight was within USA. All that was provided was cheese and biscuits but could have drunk unlimited booze. Reasonably comfortable and free wifi but became a little crowded as time went and clearing of tables slow. Poorest lounge of all I have been in.,New York JFK Airport,3.0,3,2,5.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,no
British Airways,The best thing about the BA lounge at Newcastle is the staff. I fly every week so have got to know them and they are always professional and courteous. Lounge a bit old and worn now but don’t expect BA will upgrade (they only seem to be in the business of downgrading everything these days). Good selection of drinks. Sandwiches at lunchtimes nice freshly prepared and a good selection. A nice place to wait for an hour or a bit longer. The staff are the same two or three very pleasant ladies – wish BA would commission them to train their FA colleagues in customer centricity! One negative - just one loo and it has never flushed properly since my two years using it.,Newcastle Airport,3.0,3,3,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,no
British Airways,The lounge in Terminal 5 at Stockholm-Arlanda is very basic. It is shared with other OneWorld partners and I believe is part of the Priority Pass network. The lounge is rather soulless and lacking in comfort and style. There are just medium-sized seats spread out over the lounge. The food was basic and mediocre consisting mainly of cheese and ham bread rolls and what appeared to be a quinoa salad. The standard fizzy drinks on offer. Curiously red and whte wine was available but in a beer-like pouring mechanism. In short there is no need to get to the airport early to enjoy this lounge because there is not much to enjoy unlike other BA lounges.,Stockholm Vasteras Airport,4.0,3,5,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,no
Delta Air Lines,Delta management either doesn't visit lounges outside the U.S. or doesn't care how poor the lounges they offer are. Lounges outside the USA have hot food and it's free. Drinks are free. First Class ticket gets you in. Now enter the Delta Lounge's in there home airport Atlanta. Coach snacks and alcohol. Wifi that is slow. Overcrowding. According to staff at ATL the biggest complaint is no hot food like the rest of the world. Now Delta is opting for a $695 annual fee for frequent fliers and Diamond travelers will have to pay in one year/January 2015. I'm not sure what Delta is trying to prove with this new scheme. Perhaps to let everyone know that they care more about executive pay and bonuses than the customer. Personally I'm now going to stop my loyalty to Delta and start using other better airlines. Diamond status means nothing anymore.,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,2.0,3,4,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,no
Delta Air Lines,It has been expanded and improved. Granted the food choices were still somewhat limited but the choices had increased in number. In addition there are now showers set up.,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes
British Airways,Pleasant small lounge with reasonably comfortable seating. Good views of stands and an open area outside originally used for us smokers but now banned. Shame! No hot food but fresh sandwiches and cakes. An adequate selection of drinks. As there is only one flight a day I was surprised there were not more people.,Sao Paulo Guarulhos Airport,3.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,no
British Airways,The door to the lounge is just a few feet from the security check - very convenient. A lot of chairs sofas etc. Good looking bar. Outside space has a good-ish view of planes and side view of runways. WC's were so-so. Booths are brilliant. I had a superb breakfast which was serve piping hot and very quickly. Didn't try the other goodies.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,0.0,5.0,4.0,no
British Airways,Very quiet in the middle of the day - we had 7 hours to wait between flights with our 2 year old daughter - an amazing kids room in the lounge with soundproof glass walls. You can sit outside and relax and watch the kids inside. Very good idea! Great selection of French and european wine great nibbles. Only downside - Coffee machine made terrible coffee and the restaurant did not open for the entire 7 hours we were there (not enough clients??). Still had the snack menu but no sit down fine dining as advertised. At 6.30pm it had still not opened for dinner and after asking and getting no response we left to catch our flight. I am still confused as to what was going on here. Free PCs with internet too.,Unknown,4.0,4,4,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no
Delta Air Lines,This lounge is a disgrace. The place isn't clean; the services terrible; the food non-existent; the bar more like a sports bar than a place for first class passengers to rest and wait - in short its a degraded facility much like the airline that runs it is a degraded airline. Delta should close it and go back to its former lounge services. This one (terminal 5) was/is awful.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,1.0,1,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,no
Delta Air Lines,Crowded noisy uncomfortable poor snack items - but still probably better than being out on the concourse. We tried both Sky Clubs on the B Concourse. We spent most of our time in the lounge near B25. The place was packed but we did find two chairs. The place was packed with people many of whom were yapping on their cellphones. A fair number of families some with babies who were shrieking and children who used the lounge like a gym. The snack offerings were minimal some veggies cookies pretzels etc. The espresso machine took too long to dispense a simple cup of regular coffee (no airpots). The bathrooms were a disaster - dirty smelly and as others have mentioned with the cheapest toilet paper.,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,2.0,2,1,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,no
Delta Air Lines,I've been a Delta Diamond flyer for the last year of so which gives me access to the lounge. I have written to complain about the speed of the wifi several times but they haven't done anything to improve it. I am sitting in the lounge right now connected using the access point on my phone. 6 months ago they did not charge for any of their draft beers. Now only one beer is complementary - and it isn't a good one. All I want is a nice local brew like Booklyn Lager. The complementary cabernet is Sycamore Lane - its not good either. I also tried the Merlot by the same folks. not good. I'm not a cheap guy but I'm a bit annoyed about this change. If I way paying for a business class ticket or paying for louge access I'd really be angry. I have the same comments as one of the previous posters. I'm sitting here in the lounge and there are literally 4 empty glasses from previous patrons within arms reach. Last week I got off the redeye and tried to come in to use a shower. They said it would be an hour wait. This is completely unacceptable.,New York JFK Airport,2.0,4,2,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,no
British Airways,New lounge looks good and is for BA use only. Selection of hot and cold food which was very tasty and well presented. We were on the day flight with using the 777 so lounge was very quiet. Would presume it would be busy for the evening 747 flight.,Mumbai Airport,4.0,5,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
British Airways,Lounge is comfortable enough using the same furniture as the new lounges at Heathrow T5. The problem is mosquitos that have come in not a few-but a massive amount. The catering is poor old fruitcake stale cheese and a few Indian dishes guaranteed to give stomach problems - nobody touched them! Yet they have four attendants standing around doing nothing - why spend all the money for a new lounge?,Mumbai Airport,2.0,3,3,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,no
British Airways,This lounge is a rather standard BA lounge but it does have some major flaws. Capacity is a big problem in this lounge. I have rarely been in a lounge of this size where I have not not been able to find any seating whatsoever. The lounge was absolutely packed! It was so full that I decided to leave after a while because it was not worth the effort to find some personal space in the lounge. I wanted to go on-line but apart from two free computers wireless was at a charge. I paid quite a hefty charge and I had major problems trying to connect. I could only spend five minutes on-line and I was constantly disconnected. In summary there is significant room for improvement!,Cape Town Airport,3.0,2,4,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,no
Delta Air Lines,The T4 SkyClub at JFK is the largest and newest SkyClubs in Delta's system. This lounge has a SkyDeck an open-air observation deck with a great view of the terminal area and runways. There are plenty of outlets for recharging with complimentary wifi. Inside you can order a hot meal or snack at prices that are competitive. This is the only SkyClub where you can get a meal or enjoy usual assortment of light snacks found in all SkyClubs. There is free beer wine and liquor but to get higher quality booze and a wider selection you have to pay. There are six shower rooms. The attendants keep a waiting list which seems to move quickly. Each room comes with amenities. There is a good variety of newspapers. SkyClubs that are in locations formerly run by Northwest Airlines do not have this problem.,New York JFK Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Delta Air Lines,This lounge is quite large but it does not have enough seats or space for the numbers of people passing through! There was a line out the door at one point to enter. The toilets inside were the same as the ones outside. The food on offer is the same as all Delta lounges which is limited to some raw vegetables with humus chips pretzels and other cheap snack foods. Drinks are similarly uninspired. They had special Johnny Walker drinks but for $15 extra per drink! The seats were stained from overuse. All the passengers were all hooked up to their in-ear phones and speaking loudly to people somewhere else about business making it really loud and strange. The only good thing about the lounge is the fact you get free wifi. As a passenger on an international connection in business class I was allowed to enter. You would have to be insane to pay $50 for a day pass to enter this place.,Minneapolis St Paul Airport,2.0,2,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,no
Delta Air Lines,The Sky Club at SAN is opened three weeks ago. The terminal also appears to be fairly new; so there is a very clean open and inviting feeling to it. The staff was very proud of their lounge and had a great attitude. The furniture was comfortable and there appeared to be an ample supply of electrical outlets. This lounge has a Luxury Bar which means you can pay to get high quality wine and liquor. The complimentary spirits are barely palatable but they are free. The food is the standard SkyClub packaged cheese pretzels etc. Nothing you could make a meal out of. The highlight of this lounge is that it opens on to a large balcony that overlooks the gate area! Delta has furnished this area with rocking chairs so it feels like you are sitting on your front porch but looking out over the terminal. Neat. I was there for a late night flight so the airport was relatively quite. I wonder if it would be noisy sitting on the balcony when the airport is busy. For a domestic lounge Delta did a good job with this one. It was fun.,San Diego Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,"I visited one lounge in the main part of T5 only to see a ""Boarding Now"" sign for my flight which was not departing for nearly 2 hours. It turns out they were trying to get people to the T5B satellite because of enhanced security procedures. I made my way over to T5B and used the lounge there - not crowded and plenty of food good wifi access free computers to use. All in all a pleasant quiet place to spend time before flight. One negative for BA: when I arrived at Heathrow a week previously - the Arrivals lounge at T5 had already closed promptly at 2pm. This seems very early given that the 2nd schedule SFO-LHR flight arrives at 2 pm.",London Heathrow Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no
British Airways,One would have thought that British Airways/Jersey would have taken notice of R Pemberton's review of this lounge - 12 August 2009. Absolutely nothing has changed - for the better that is. At the time of my visit (late afternoon) dirty crockery was strewn across the tables. The elderly male attendant did not even bother to look up when I entered so no check of my credentials and certainly not greeting. It may be that BA Jersey are trying to save on electricity but I could not find any other reason for all the ceiling lights being switched off. There are table lamps but it was difficult to read the dog-eared newspapers on the shelves. Carpets and upholstery are still filthy so no change there. I used the newly built lavatory which appeared not to have been cleaned that day. I live in Jersey and this is my local airport. What sort of impression does this hellhole make on departing passengers?,Jersey Airport,1.0,1,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
British Airways,The recent experience of the BA Terraces lounge at Gatwick was one of total shock - since my last visit in October. 50% of the facility has been closed - what was on two floors providing a very good experience - is now an insult to every BA Club World customer - as it is now located on 1 floor. Passengers cannot find seats (due to overcrowding) - and me and my family of 4 had to half stand and half sit as we ate our snack breakfast. BA's cost cutting has reached a new and deeply insulting low in the way it treats it's premium customers - thankful I am flying with another airline this month to New Zealand.,London Gatwick Airport,2.0,1,3,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,no
Delta Air Lines,The Lounge is good nothing much. Snacks only and you can't get food from outside. You can't really find a place to sleep or relax sometimes it's nearly full. Recommended only if you are staying a long time at the airport.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Delta Air Lines,What a disappointment this lounge is. Carrots celery olives cheese & crackers are the free food choices. There is a restaurant in the lounge but we went outside to order. There were dirty dishes throughout the lounge and no one seemed eager to clean up. Thread bare towels that I am not even sure were clean. We spent good money for two Business class tickets to Italy had to spend 4 hours in JFK.,New York JFK Airport,3.0,3,2,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,no
Delta Air Lines,It is insulting that after having paid a premium for a business class ticket you are then required to pay for virtually everything in its lounge - unless you are satisfied with 'yogurt-covered pretzels' and a mass-produced domestic bottled beer. Another first is being required to present your passport at check-in. The space has had some thought put into its design but the lighting is very bright and customer service indifferent at best. This is in no way an international lounge (nor airline) on par with those of its partners KLM and Air France. Instead head across T4 to the Oasis Lounge where the bar is open food free and Faux Noise isn't blaring over the chatter. And you're not required to show your passport.,New York JFK Airport,2.0,4,4,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,no
British Airways,This is a very cold and dull lounge. The staff are far from welcoming - it's as if you have ruined their day just by being there. As someone else mentioned there is evidence of cost cutting throughout - fine for those in economy but not what one expects after paying so much more for a business class experience. The refreshments on offer were pathetic. I was there for an early morning flight and there were baskets of mini croissants and pan au chocolat cereal toast and coffee/juices etc. 100% self-service. Miserable staff hanging around like vultures ready to clear your table before you have finished swallowing your last mouthful. You can go out to the duty free shops but they don't bother to offer to look after your bags and coats so you need to lug them around with you if you are carrying anything of value which I usually am (laptop etc).,London Gatwick Airport,2.0,2,3,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Arrived at Suvarnabhumi Airport a little early in order to check out BA/QF first class lounge. Very disappointed. Nothing special - if anything the Business Class lounge opposite was as good if not better. The First lounge was small very limited food - cheese platter 2 choices two types of rolls and wraps. Only difference between business and First was choice of wines and champagne.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,4.0,3,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no

Delta Air Lines,Sitting in lounge right now. The new outdoor area is nice but charging $3 for a beer? What kind of lounge does that? Have beer prices risen that much? Terribly slow wifi connection and the lounge gets really crowded. Food selection is nothing compared to other international lounges.,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,3.0,3,4,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,yes
Delta Air Lines,Disappointed to see the same old in JFK. Here you pay for anything beyond lousy wine and celery/crackers/olives. They have even eliminated cheese! I fly monthly business-class to London - and whilst I enjoy the Delta lounge at Heathrow I find the new JFK T4 lounge another American embarrassment - why can't we behave as other lounges do?,New York JFK Airport,3.0,5,5,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,no
British Airways,Not worth the extra cost in my opinion. The lounge was busy - it was difficult to get a seat. The breakfast was paltry - tiny croissants for instance. There was no sense of luxury - an air of convenience and cost-effectiveness. Staff were not particularly polite.,London Heathrow Airport,2.0,1,3,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,no
British Airways,Though this lounge is very new it really is not big enough to handle the 2 flights which leave quite close together in the evening. The staff however are exemplary - very welcoming professional and friendly with a real sense of enjoying their interaction with the passengers. There is a good selection of food and drinks with very acceptable pre-flight dining. If only the T5 lounges were the same as this one.,Philadelphia Airport,5.0,4,5,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
British Airways,Shocked is all I can say. After trying the Concorde Lounge earlier in the year the Terraces was a huge let down. We got to the airport 4 hours before the flight yet told the spa was full. The food was mediocre we had to ask for champagne. It was comfortable enough and the wifi was good.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,4,3,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,no
Delta Air Lines,I am writing this while sitting in the lounge for a KLM flight. Large lounge with a restaurant in the middle. Complimentary food served here some veggy crackers olives and cheese. Soft drinks cheap red and white wine and beer complimentary - anything else needs to be paid for. Shame on you KLM using this lounge. This lounge has earned the medal for the worst.,New York JFK Airport,3.0,3,3,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,no
Delta Air Lines,A lot less cosy than what I remembered visiting this lounge 6 years back. I suppose the fact that it was really crowded made it more like a higher end gate waiting lounge than a business class lounge. There were lots of corners where you can potentially find your own corner but I think that the place is approaching overcapacity. There is a good selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages available (with Blue Moon Belgian beer on tap!) and a healthy selection of munchies as well as coffee. Wifi was fast and reliable and there were enough TV screens to help while the time away while waiting for boarding. Toilets were in horrible condition.,Detroit Airport,4.0,4,3,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,yes
Delta Air Lines,Lounge is very poor in comparison to other airlines business lounges throughout the world. Only 2 showers for which you have to register your name and be called when they are available. Food selection is basic snack type but not readily replenished. Layout is not very well optimised and seating is limited. Overall appearance was drab & uninviting. Certainly does not live up to the description on their website.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,3.0,2,3,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
British Airways,As a Gold card member I could use this lounge (unlike Heathrow's Concorde lounge which is exclusive for 1st passengers) as I awaited my flight to Antigua. Carpet very worn and dull as was most of the chairs and seating; everything felt like a 60s time warp. Food/breakfast was OK - nothing to speak about. Coffee machine appeared to be the only thing different to the club terraces option. Disappointing.,London Gatwick Airport,2.0,3,3,2.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,no
British Airways,It's the attentive staff that makes this lounge a real pleasure. Staff members have always gone the extra mile to deal with seating upgrade and flight change and other special requests. Efficiency and smiles are a great combination. Food and drink are average but adequate. Too bad the washrooms are outside the lounge.,Berlin Tegel Airport,3.0,4,5,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,no
British Airways,This lounge is shared by BA and Qantas and doesn't have many seats. So unless you get there quite early you might find it difficult to find a seat. The seats are old and need a make over. The choice of drinks is limited. Only one red one white and one sparkling wine (not champagne). The choice of food was limited to nuts fruit cold finger sandwiches cheese and crackers and Asian snacks (very tasty). Okay selections of newspapers no TV screens and a limited number of IT stations with one out of order. The lavatories were clean and so were the shower rooms.,Hong Kong Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,no
Delta Air Lines,Visited both Delta lounges in Minneapolis. Lounge C was extremely quiet also has a nice view of planes landing and taking off and I believe its bigger than the other one. The self-service bar still exists there. The other lounge at terminal F/G is more modern more of open and the bar is more lively but there's no open bar there. Both lounges : same snack pretzels hummus crackers apples coffee and some newspapers. Free fast internet connection and excellent staff. I spent 10 minutes at the LAX lounge more snacks but it was relatively crowded.,Unknown,4.0,5,5,4.0,3.0,0.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Delta Air Lines,"Regular visitor as Diamond member over many years. Continue to be disappointed in the food assortment of Delta lounges. Standard fare are crackers plastic wrapped cheese slices seasoned pretzel/nuts rather than healthy nuts bagels carrot and celery sticks. Why not a better selection of fruit real fruit juices rather then the high fructose ""fruit"" drinks some decent bread and yogurt selection some warm snacks/pastas such as offered at other clubs. We do not expect Delta to reach the 5 star quality of Singapore airlines and others but this is barely making for a 3-star experience. It even pales with the 3-star rating of KLM and Air France sky team partners. One can fly to various locations worldwide for 70% of the Delta business fare on Singapore Airlines and Emirates for example and have a 5-star experience. Business class fares on Delta have gone out of sight (especially for what is offered as a package)!",Detroit Airport,3.0,3,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
Delta Air Lines,Very disappointing. Delta does not have a lounge in Rome. I have a priority pass. My husband did not bring his priority pass so we paid for him. Alitalia lounge was very hot air quality is bad. I am here at the lounge writing this review. The women at the desk one in particular did not even raise her face to ask me what I need. I wanted to ask if there is wifi! Very rude people and the lady trying to clean the tables was rude. We are not eat anything nor drinking anything for it is very uncomfortable. Delta should investigate this relationship with Alitalia and to tell people that in Rome they do not have a lounge.

The food served is quite good all Italian style focaccia sandwiches small pizzas etc. The choice of drinks is good with lots of typical Italian drinks available.

Delta Air Lines,Probably the poorest lounge I ever saw on a great international airport. Awkward seats and tables and in particular no reasonable food. Only some nuts and crackers along with small cheese pieces packed in plastic foil. On the plus side: rest rooms clean.

Delta Air Lines,Recently visited 2 different Sky Club lounges in Atlanta terminals T and A. Club entrances are hidden down short halls and poorly marked. No inviting feeling to entering the lounges. Staff and the check in desks were friendly and helpful. The overall appearance is that of a tired out of date environment. Lounges seemed cramped and small. Furniture in the A terminal was actually dirty and stained. The snacks appeared old and picked over. Bathrooms were old looking cramped and dirty. The Delta staff were the only good part of the experience. The American Airline Admirals Clubs in Miami and Dallas-Fort Worth put the Atlanta clubs to shame for overall appearance and welcoming feeling.,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,2.0,3,2,0.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,no
British Airways,This is a shared lounge used by several airlines - pleasantly surprised with plenty of seating available. Lounge looks modern with lots of natural daylight spacious clean. On one side is quite a large bar. No self service for coffee tea etc you go to the bar and have your drink prepared for you - I think this gives a more personal service. On the bar is a menu listing available sandwiches. Around the lounge were monitors displaying flight information and announcements were made frequently about boarding or gate changes which is in contrast to Heathrow T5 where there are no announcements. I prefer announcements as you don't need to keep getting up. Near reception is a smoking room with a television displaying the news. The smoking room was as comfortable as the main lounge and was just as clean with staff clearing cups and plates regularly across the entire lounge. A magazine rack was located near the entrance with daily newspapers and magazines in Russian Ukrainian and English but staff weren't clearing left newspapers often. When my flight was called the gate was literally 30 feet away. This lounge certainly was a relaxing retreat away from the crowds and I wish more were like this.,Kiev Borispol Airport,3.0,5,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,no
British Airways,This is easily the poorest of all the BA 1st class lounges I have frequented. It is a reasonably large space which fills up very rapidly within a few hours of the 2 to 3 late night flights back to London. Very often you will struggle to find a comfortable seat. I no longer eat anything in this lounge as the quality of the catering is not up to scratch. You will hardly ever find a UK newspaper (unless you are 3-4 hours early) and I can't think of a single redeeming feature of this lounge - not even a good view. It is well overdue a complete refurbishment and the general decor is grubby and tatty. Singapore - London is a very busy route for BA and presumably therefore somewhat profitable. If you travel the same route with Singapore Airlines the lounges are far superior as is the general lounge service.,Singapore Changi Airport,2.0,2,2,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,no
Delta Air Lines,Hidden in between gates at the degrading Memphis International Airport. The desk staff are generally curt and rude which I have come to expect at airport lounges. Open full bar consists of self-pour liquor. Pretty decent brands not top-shelf or anything but respectable. The house wines are decent enough i.e. a step above boxed wine. The snacks are laughable carrots celery packaged ranch mixed nuts and crackers abound. The bar area wasn't that clean either. The advantage of this lounge is that it is quiet (in spite of how many people were there) a function of the numerous small rooms. The chairs are comfortable and the soft lighting was nice. Free WIFI NYT and WSJ as well. Bathrooms leave something to be desired.,Memphis Airport,4.0,5,4,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Delta Air Lines,On most concourses they lounges are located upstairs so it's either a lengthy wait for an elevator or the stairs. For those of you who have not been to ATL it's hot! When you arrive in this lounge it's crowded and you have to request beers. The food is usually old and looks picked over. Some of the seating is comfortable others not. It's not a terrible place to go for a drink while you wait for your flight but the VIP feeling is lacking.,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,no
Delta Air Lines,For international flights departing from Brussels Skyteam Elite and Elite plus members use the British Airways lounge - quality and service are top notch! The front desk people are friendly and helpful. The seating is mediocre but drink and food selection make up for that. They have the most delicious pastries in the morning. The only negative is that there is no restroom inside the lounge. You have to walk a bit far down the hall to reach the nearest toilet.,Brussels Zaventem Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,yes
British Airways,I found the lounge very comfortable. Enough space for everyone although it was a Friday before a bank holiday weekend. The choice of hot food is limited but appropriate. Used plates and glasses are promptly removed by the staff who are polite and assist requests promptly. I didn't use the showers but the Elemis receptionist went out of her way and gave me her unused personal Elemis lip saver although these products were not generally available to passengers. BA should improve the magazines selection.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
British Airways,The new club lounge at T3 is very nice large and spacious with different seating areas. There was a large selection of both hot and cold food. The red and white wines are in different seating areas which is slightly strange and champagne is only available if you ask. The staff were attentive and customer service could not be faulted.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
British Airways,Great improvement on the old lounge. Quite small but well appointed. The First restaurant excellent - although we were the only two customers - with service both efficient and attentive. Bit of a walk to get there from the underpass walkway however although if you're not in a desperate hurry it's no real problem. As usual this comes at the end of a mass of confusion and waiting for security even in the Premium queue.,Washington Dulles Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no
Delta Air Lines,I recently waited out a long delay (6 hours) at the Sky Club in Terminal 2 at JFK. Overall this is a spacious lounge with a mix of seating areas (TV lounge bar workstations etc). While the lounge was busy it never felt overly packed. The staff were efficient and drink menu was extensive but as is common with Sky Clubs the food selection was limited to light snacks. One desk agent provided excellent service when my flight was cancelled and worked to minimize the disruption and provide me with options. Given the overall poor state of Terminal 2 it was much less stressful to out the delay in the club rather than in the general boarding area.,New York JFK Airport,3.0,4,3,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes
Delta Air Lines,This is a very busy lounge. The worst part (other than there's practically no snacks) is that the Men's room is an absolute disaster / pig stye / complete mess no matter the time or day of the week that you visit. On top of this the 'free' T-mobile internet service may as well be nothing at all. It is beyond slow probably worse than 512k dial up. Why?,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,1.0,3,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
British Airways,"This is the new improved lounge and is for those entitled to ""First Class"" privileges but not travelling First Class I was travelling domestically so this was why I used this lounge. Seriously this is the best BA can come up with after how many years. I asked for the restaurant and was shown the buffet. The lounge was nice even allowing for the fact that it was hot in some areas and cool in others. Showers were basic. Staff friendly and helpful. Not worth the effort to try it out.",London Heathrow Airport,3.0,2,4,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
British Airways,Had a longish layover due to BA delay and resulting re-booking so decided to use one of the cabanas. These are hotel-style rooms with day bed TV and music and a private bath. Had champagne and lunch delivered to the room so very nice. Then I discovered that the room only had one temperature - freezing cold Also the rooms back up to what may be a kitchen with constant banging of doors and other loud noises. Not very much chance of getting a rest here. Finally moved out into the lounge proper which is already showing some signs of wear and struggles to accomodate everyone at busy times. Restaurant food choices are rather uninspired and presentation not of the highest standard. Service can be inconsistent. For an exclusively First Class lounge this could be better.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no
Delta Air Lines,The new Sky Club at Seatac is a huge improvement over the previous overcrowded club. There is much more space so that it's not teeming with travelers late morning and midday when a number of flights to Asia leave. Excellent facilities for laptops and charging devices. There's a good bar with a number of premium (and pricey) selections - you can still get the house selections at no charge. The snack selection is minimal. Sky Club staff are friendly efficient and helpful as they were in the old club. There's a good view of Mount Rainier out the window - on a clear day.,Seattle Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Delta Air Lines,Delta SkyClub at CVG is one of the nicer ones. The club is large and conveniently located for transferring passengers. It offers a mix of seating types a large window that offers views of the field. The staff were quite friendly. In many ways this club is nicer than many of those at ATL and other Delta hub cities.,Cincinnati Airport,3.0,5,5,4.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,yes
Delta Air Lines,I recently spent approximately 90 minutes in the PDX Sky Club prior to boarding a red-eye flight to ATL. Overall the PDX club was fine. It was of a decent size with a mix of seating areas and types (TV lounge quiet areas bar etc.). The only negative was that the club was lightly staffed (one agent and one bar attendant) and both staffers clearly were looking to hustle people out of the club and close up for the night; in fact the bar attendant spent most of her time away from the bar. The club had a decent number of people waiting in it but it didn't feel crowded. Also the club only has one TV which means that people have a choice of just one program.,Portland Airport,3.0,4,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
British Airways,I recently read a review on this website regarding the Terrace lounge facilities at Jersey airport and was shocked to find it had deteriorated even further from the original submission. Food and dirty plates had been left out for many hours stained carpets and a poorly stocked bar compounded by a member of staff deciding to leave the lounge at 8 pm half an hour before the last flight was due to depart. Passengers had no idea it had incurred a delay and our only source of information came from data streams located on TV’s 100m away from the lounge. Simply terrible British Airways I would recommend that anyone flying Business class from Jersey attempts to spend as much time away from the lounge as you will only be disappointed with the service.,Jersey Airport,1.0,2,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Club Europe Lounge at Gatwick is very nice. It is on two floors and very spacious. The food selection is simple (only sandwiches pasta salads and similar and cheese with biscuits) plus the usual snacks. The only hot food served is soup. Very good selection of drinks with champagne on request very good selection of newspapers and magazines. IT workstations worked very well and are very modern. The toilet facilities are good with excellent showers and you can ask for Elemis products. The only downside was the lack of atmosphere. The lounge is very quite and with no music played in the background it could have been very boring.,London Gatwick Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
British Airways,Small but fine for the number of travellers on the day. Good atmosphere. Standard of food and drink good but range limited in comparison to say Galleries. so scores down a little.,Montréal Airport,4.0,4,5,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Delta Air Lines,The style of this lounge is in a Southern plantation setting. I found it clean neat and well kept up. There was no trash sitting around waiting to be picked up on the tables. Kids area was a nice area with a lot of choices for them to pick from. The problem with this and other Delta lounges the food selection is very poor. Tailmix cookies and fruit can only go so far.,Orlando Airport,3.0,4,4,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,no
Delta Air Lines,I have to agree - reception desk is neither inviting nor friendly. We had a miserable experience checking in with Laura - she was rude completely unhelpful and frankly dismissive. I have never in my life experienced that level of unfriendly customer service - anywhere! Naturally I asked to speak to her manager. She called her manager on the phone spoke to him and then reported to me that he didn't want to talk to me - he was too busy. And then she hung up the phone. Fortunately a Delta representative happened to walk by and we were able to flag her down and she immediately helped us and we were settled into the lounge. We let her know how rude the reception is at the front and yes we called out Laura specifically. I thought it was so weird that upon seeing our displeasure with her service that Laura never apologized that her manager didn't want to speak to us and that in the end it was a Delta rep and not a Sky Team rep who ended up assisting us and providing customer service. I have sent a letter to Sky Team and Delta to tell them about the experience and to reiterate that the front desk needs customer service training and possibly better management - clearly there isn't much supervision going on up front.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,4,3,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Only food available was cheese and crackers. A waitress eventually appeared but did not approach anyone - she had to be asked for drinks. She brought them through and was never seen again. The room is fully enclosed and looks out on the seating area in the departure lounge - before security. The decor is drab a few magazines to read as well as some out of date newspapers. Couldn't wait to get on the plane. Shame as it soured the end of our holiday slightly.,Antigua Vc Bird Airport,1.0,2,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,no
British Airways,Pretty busy lounge with good wifi and announcement when new UK newspapers arrived. Alcoholic drinks only available through a servery with occasional missing staff and therefore short queues and delays. Pleasant and efficient staff.,Seattle Airport,4.0,4,5,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,no
Delta Air Lines,Small lounge it was hard to find a seat. No real meal choices difficult to get something to drink as the bar tender was always leaving the bar. Everything seemed quite dirty. Staff uninterested they send passengers for the Air France flight to Paris one hour to early to the gate. Not really a nice place.,Miami Airport,2.0,2,1,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,no
Delta Air Lines,The lounge is located in the satellite building next to gate 18. Very convenient for the gates. The welcome was a little rehearsed and not particularly friendly (but not unfriendly). The lounge is medium size but during my visit very busy. Available food was nuts shrink wrapped cheese and some carrot sticks. Drinks available from a server with a rather stern attitude. I had a G&T but it looked well stocked (although the tonic was from one of those awful fizzy drink guns). The seat was dirty and the rest of the lounge felt grubby warm and crowded. There were high tables to sit at and plenty of power outlets throughout. There's one hour free wireless in the airport. Not sure if there is free wireless in the lounge. Overall I was disappointed but have been to worse lounges.,Boston Logan Airport,1.0,2,2,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,no
Delta Air Lines,I found this lounge to be characterless and a little unfriendly. The toilets were filthy but the rest of the lounge was clean. Plenty of seating - watch out for the dangling lights I saw one man hit his head very hard when getting up from his seat. I was there early in the morning and breakfast was available - average nothing special. Alcohol was not available in the lounge until after 10am (my flight was at 9:30!).,London Heathrow Airport,2.0,3,4,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,no
Delta Air Lines,The 4Deck Lounge was remarkably easy to find. It was somewhat crowded the morning I visited - a nice selection of cheese crackers drinks etc. My disappointment was the inability to connect to wifi and limited tools available on the lounge computers. The host tried to connect me to wifi without success.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,no
Delta Air Lines,Delta Sky Club system in Terminal E has 2 clubs. Both have some snacks soft drinks bad coffee and lots of booze. According to the advertisements Delta is now a world class airline. If these lounges are any indication Delta is a poster boy for how not to be a world class airline. There are no showers no tooth brushes no changing rooms no food except snacks no fruit juices no computers and no telephones. It seems that all you have is what you can bring with you. I'm not comparing Delta to airlines such as Singapore British Airways and Korean lounges which are great but to US carrier lounges which far surpass the Delta product.,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,2.0,4,4,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,no
Delta Air Lines,I went to several Sky Club lounges (MSP MSY RDU) and they are adequate. They do not offer much in the way of food but not bad if your flight is delayed. There is free wifi in all the lounges and even computer use for those not traveling with their own. The one I entered in terminal E at ATL was really not good. It was the old style (not renovated like many are now) quite large but very crowded. There were numerous children in there! Staff behind the bar were unprofessional and talking about inter-lounge politics and not attentive to staff and the bathrooms were dirty and locks didn't lock properly. It's just slightly better than being in the general boarding area.,Unknown,3.0,2,2,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,no
Delta Air Lines,"Either I've become spoiled by (even domestic lounges) lounges in other countries and of other airlines or Delta has set a low bar. Coffee is a ready mix type machine and taste as such. A simple drip machine from Target would serve a much better product. The food selection well there was none. Yogurt some granola and not a bowl insight to put it in. The rest was cookie/biscuit type snacks. If alcohol were a staple of any sort one would be in luck. Plenty of booze and beer. Get a clue Delta! You are supposedly a ""World Class"" airline now.",Los Angeles Lax Airport,2.0,3,3,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no
Delta Air Lines,Personnel are very pleasant but the facility is grossly overcrowded. Before the purchase of Northwest Delta had its lounge (larger and more comfortable) in the B Concourse. Now that lounge has closed and Sky Club operates in the South Satellite. There are just too many passengers on too many international flights that all seem to leave within an hour or so of each other.,Seattle Airport,3.0,1,3,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Emirates,"We were returning to Glasgow from Langkawi via Kuala Lumpur and Dubai, and had 6 hours in KL so we decided to go to the Lounge. I was only allowed for one extra guest to the lounge but they let me take my two kids as well. Some great food, and array of drinks, tea, coffee, beers and soft drinks. There was a great window to see aircraft and there was good wifi. There were many computers. There were no Sofas. ",KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,9.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,"I have used Emirates lounges around the world and this is one of the best. It's just the right size to hold a full A380's worth of First and Business passengers without looking overcrowded. The food was excellent with plenty of hot and cold choices, desserts and lots of good French cheeses. There's the usual self service bar, fridges full of soft drinks and freshly squeezed juices, champagne and wine and a good coffee machine. There's plenty of comfortable seating and a nice observation deck outside where you can stand and watch the A380 arrive and park up right outside. it has a good business centre and nice bathrooms with showers. Overall a very nice and relaxing environment.",Paris CDG Airport,10.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,"This is the best Emirates Lounge I've used mainly because the food is so good but it's also a very nice, relaxing environment to wait before your 8 hour flight back to Dubai. The first time I used it I checked in at 7pm for a midnight flight so spent several hours there. The second time not so long but on both occasions we had an excellent 3 course restaurant standard meal with lots of good, Far Eastern and European choices which were constantly replenished by the busy staff. There's 2 self service bar areas with good aged spirits, mixers, wine and champagne and a good coffee machine. After dinner we relaxed in the comfy chairs and passed the time with a few drinks, magazines and newspapers. There's a good business centre, free wifi and bathrooms with showers. Overall Excellent, well done Emirates.",Hong Kong Airport,10.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,"I have transited Dubai many times on Emirates who use Terminal 3 which is broken down into Concourse A/B/C. I have used all 3 Business lounges and A is by far the best as it's new. C is old and tired and B is under renovation so avoid, if you have a long layover take the short train ride to A. The Business Lounge in A is massive and runs the whole length of the building with several food areas, seating areas, bathrooms with showers, business centres etc. The beauty of this lounge is that it has a proper smoking lounge with good ventilation so as a non smoker traveling with a smoker I don't mind going in. It's a proper bar with chesterfield sofas and TV's on the walls, not just a smoke room. In the food areas there's a hot buffet and lots of cold choices, fruit, yogurts etc. Plenty of drinks options and coffee machines that make a very nice macchiato. A is also the A380 terminal so has the 2 deck air bridges and you board directly from the lounge. A is a 10 but I've given 8/10 due to the other 2 lounges.",Dubai Airport,8.0,5,4,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,"I often use this lounge as I have the Emirates Gold card so get a lounge invitation regardless what class I'm flying in. It's typical of most Emirates lounges as they all have the same decor and furniture although this one is quite small when compared to Heathrow. There's always 2 staff in Emirates uniform at check-in who are always warm and friendly and will explain everything if it's your first time. There's comfortable seating with little coffee tables to your left with a big TV and the dining area and self service bar is on the right. And I mean self service, there's no annoying staff who try to pour your drink for you. I've never had a bad meal here, the food is always excellent with plenty of choice. There's a hot buffet and always a soup and a chiller with cold starters, deserts and cheeses. They have 2 self service bar areas with a good choice of spirits, wine and champagne and fridges full of mixers, beers and water, a good coffee machine and lots of tea choices. There's the usual business area with computers and a printer and there's nice bathrooms with showers. The only negative is there's virtually no mobile phone signal.",Birmingham Airport,8.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,"The Emirates Lounge in Delhi is awesome and massive, there's only 4 Emirates flights to Dubai per day, all at least 5 hours apart so I'm not sure why this lounge is so big, however my son and I enjoyed it on our stopover from Kathmandu to London via Dubai especially after the nightmare of the transit gates in Delhi! The food was excellent with plenty of hot and cold choices. There's a self service bar with a good choice of spirits, mixers, beers, wine and champagne plus a good coffee machine and teas. You get well looked after on Emirates. After dinner we found another self service bar at the far end of the lounge which we had virtually to ourselves. There's more than enough comfortable seating all around. There's a good business centre and bathrooms with showers. The only negative it was too warm, the air con wasn't cool enough. Overall a nice haven from the chaos outside.",Delhi Airport,9.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,It is a common lounge for many airlines oprating from Lagos. Seating is not too comfortable. During peak hours even getting a place to sit is difficult. Food and drink availabilty is Ok. Service quality is poor. Better place to spend time waiting for boarding as other waiting areas at Lagos Airport is horrible.,Lagos Airport,5.0,3,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,yes
Emirates,We got to the lounge at 4.30 am. It was pretty busy. We decided to have a shower after long flight. We were very lucky because the showers were free. In 1 hour the lounge was packed which is not too bad because it's such a big and spacious lounge. HOWEVER there are 3 blocks of male toilets and only 1 block of female toilets which I found unacceptable! They are doing refurbishments so I just hope there will be more female toilets in very near future. There were queues for female toilets and showers. The demand is absolutely not met for female passengers.,Dubai Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,Probably the worst lounge I've been in that has been in its home country. Certainly the noisiest I've ever been in anywhere at all. Virtually nothing to eat here apart from 4 slices of cheese on 3 plates and some actually decent looking bread rolls with nothing to go in them. There are little verrines of synthetic looking desserts but not what you'd expect in Morocco at all - nothing vaguely traditional. I headed for the one stainless steel covered container to find what looked like two snails inside. I like snails but these looked as if they had suffered some nuclear mutation so I decided to give them a miss and settled for a glass of red wine and nothing to eat. Tried to find somewhere to charge my laptop with a UK plug and the lady at the desk asked her (male) colleague who refused even to look at me and shrugged in the direction of a wall. Nothing to be seen when I looked. I went back and showed them the plug and she tittered as if I'd shown her a rubber duck or something. A management type came to the desk ands she asked him. He too refused to look at me and just shrugged. I don't mind - although I think it's a bit odd - that they don't have a socket I can use - I usually have an adaptor with me - but the entire concept of customer services seems to have passed them by. Surprised that Emirates want to use this lounge! I work in Saudi Arabia and even there the male staff at the airport are happy to look at women and smile - and help! No announcements in English - fine for me but not so great for those who don't speak either Arabic or rapid French. Really poor!,Casablanca Airport,3.0,2,5,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no
Emirates,This was a very sorry excuse for a business lounge. Far too small and a poor selection of food and beverage. Maybe more time should have been spent on practical chairs and space than on decor!,Copenhagen Airport,2.0,1,5,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Emirates,The lounge is a joke. It is small hence there is little chance of getting a table to yourself. I don't eat meat and I had the choice of rice lukewarm polenta bread crackers cheese salad and fruit. Pitiful. No Baileys.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,2.0,1,3,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,no
Emirates,At 7.30am this huge lounge was impossibly crowded with long queues for the toilets - and even to get a cup of coffee. It was difficult to find a comfortable seat and the food was unappetising. We had 2½ hours turnaround between flights - nowhere near enough in an airport of this size long walks between gates and with long queues for security as well. We wanted a quiet relaxing break breakfast and shower after long flights from New Zealand. No chance - the experience was uncomfortable and stressful. No chance of a shower either - more long queues - facilities totally inadequate for an airport of this size.,Dubai Airport,2.0,2,3,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,no
Emirates,After a long flight from Sydney I had 2 hours in the Emirates lounge concourse B before my connecting flight to Brussels. A nightmare! I spent the entire 2 hours with 10-15 other tired men waiting in queue to take a shower. The lounge is huge and crowded not the kind of place where you can relax and unwind. This is clearly the chink in Emirates armor. They should make separate lounges for business class and for silvers. Next time star alliance. Writing this whilst still waiting for a shower. Must have seen at least 40 persons come and leave shaking their head when they saw the queue. Lots of staff around but what's the point when the only thing they can do is ask to see your boarding pass over and over again.,Dubai Airport,2.0,2,4,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Emirates,This lounge is not operated by Emirates but it is the one they give access to. It is terrible. Full with passengers from multiple airlines.

Emirates,Had a 10 hr stop over on the outward trip to Perth sat in the A lounge for half the time service not at all friendly food average noticed there were two shower rooms both had 4 people waiting to use them gave up after a while and went to the hotel out of the lounge and used their showers at least they had 10 rooms although it was $15 was well worth it. Eventually was told on the 8th hour there was a B lounge closer to my departure gate not at all easy to find signs up in the air with arrows pointing every where more relaxer chairs needed and more customer friendly staff needed. On the return trip with a 2hr stop over showers still over crowded. Emirates need to address this shortfall before they lose clients to other airlines,Dubai Airport,2.0,3,4,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no

Emirates,A relatively new lounge and a VAST improvement on the previous offering at Glasgow. Typical Emirates decor but very light and open. Staff at the reception desk were welcoming and took the time to give a personal tour of the lounge facilities to first time visitors. Seating gave a high level of privacy if required as well as more communal seating arrangements.

Emirates,My first experience of the First Class Lounge in Dubai and I was not impressed. It was very impersonal and I was disappointed. The only marked difference from the Business Lounges was that it was Table served for Dining. The offerings were nothing special either. I was absolutely appalled to find a large open Smoking area adjoining the Dining Room with dreadful tobacco smells drifting right through. Very Poor indeed. Frankly I would prefer the Business Lounges at Dubai and would certainly not pay the money to use First again.,Dubai Airport,3.0,2,3,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,no
Emirates,Enough space and seating arrangement for the guests. Good place to relax before boarding with good choice of food & beverages. Staff assists with the boarding time. Overall a good place to spend time at Delhi T3.,Delhi Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,This lounge hardly qualifies as a lounge at all. It has no shower facilities it's sparsely furnished in a very stark environment that resembles a doctors surgery. No dedicated wireless ( you have to access the Logan airport free wifi and keep logging in when it locks you out). Frankly you would be better off hanging out in the general concourse which is what we ended up doing. The so called lounge is in the Jet Blue terminal which is a budget type US airline and the lounge resembles a budget type lounge. Certainly not what one would expect from an airline like Emirates. At the risk of sounding like a snob when one travels business class you expect certain things in a lounge. For anyone who has visited the Qantas lounge in Karratha airport (regional airport in NW Australia) expect a slightly lower standard and that Emirates Boston Logan Airport. This lounge lets Emirates reputation down big time.,Boston Logan Airport,2.0,2,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,no
Emirates,This has to be the biggest let down of the Emirates experience . I was in the older terminal as I was flying on a 777 and the lounge is terrible. Breakfast of cold toast lined up in baskets and who knows how long it has been sitting there. Showers - there are only a few for the couple of hundred passengers and there was no cold water only hot. Toilets the same three men's cubicles so a line was the order of the day. Lastly they have a smoking area that leaks smoke to the general area. Having flown through JFK LAX SYD HKG KUL SIN LHR in the last 4 months on a variety of carriers this lounge gets the worst award. Emirates needs some serious work here on the basics.,Dubai Airport,2.0,1,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,no

Emirates,The lounge for Emirates is good but can be better. The food is always excellent as well as the good view of the airport. The Wi-Fi is at an acceptable speed and there were sockets everywhere where you can plug in your device to charge. The beverages were amazing coffee juice and water. Apart from sockets there were a lot of seats and tables as well as (2) fountains. Quite disappointed that there wasn't any lie-flat seats.,Unknown,4.0,4,5,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,yes
Emirates,My experience was great. Arrived at 1.30 AM from Dammam. No crowds had an excellent 4 hour sleep in one of the quiet lounges on one of the beds. I had a shower no queues. Showers clean warm/hot water well ventilated and everything provided. WiFi access easy and speed was good. Food and service excellent and enough seating till my flight to Brisbane departed at 10.30 AM. Bottom line a very good lounge to have a 9 hour layover.,Dubai Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,Had a 20 hour stop over in Dubai so plenty of time to sample several lounges. From previous poor experiences of the lounges I checked into the transit hotel- which was excellent. On this occasion the lounges were almost empty - probably due to Ramadan- and the staff outnumbered passengers. It almost made the lounges pleasant- but not quite. The only really good thing about the lounges are the staff in the lounge (and I exclude the reception staff who check you in).,Dubai Airport,3.0,1,5,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,no
Emirates,I loved the fact that it was quiet no announcements clean nice food selection. I did prefer the Sydney Emirates lounge.,Dubai Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,Rather crowded but offering a good selection of food at breakfast time. It was good to get away from the hell that is the shopping area. However the continual extremely loud flight announcements really bothered us. Surely in this day and age Business class travellers can rely on the excellent flight info available on the screens in the lounge. This repeated noise ruined our experience and prevented us from relaxing before our next flight. The toilet facilities also seemed to be insufficient.,Dubai Airport,4.0,3,5,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,The cleanliness of the lounge and the toilets let down the Emirates experience. The reception staff x 3 did nothing except chat to them selves and left the customer area tables full of clutter. Surprised at this standard.,Dublin Airport,2.0,3,1,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
Emirates,Not easy to find despite printed instructions handed out at the check-in. Small and clean with comfortable cushioned arm-chairs but few facilities beyond coffee and snacks. Clearly a waiting room not a transit lounge.,Kansai Osaka Airport,3.0,4,5,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,yes
Emirates,An absolute joke! Cannot understand how Emirates can be associated with such a lounge. It is just a cordoned off area in the main departure lounge. The lounge was dirty and in desperate need of a major overhaul. The food was appalling with very poor choice. Not sure if the reason for my sickness in Dubai airport was the result of eating one small sandwich! Available drinks limited to beer colas etc and hot beverages. Wine was available but on payment of approximately £10 for a very small bottle (about a large wine glass). There are no toilet facilities in the lounge. All in all a very disappointing experience especially after great treatment aboard Emirates flights and the lounges at Manchester and Dubai.,Phuket Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
Emirates,Very pleasantly surprised with this lounge. Plenty of room really great friendly staff. I was genuinely shocked by the breakfast food in the lounge - an immense selection and all of very high quality. The poached eggs waiting there were cooked to perfection. Bathrooms very clean with nice hand towels. An absolute standout for a business lounge.,Sydney Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Emirates,This is better than the Emirates business lounges in Dubai. It is fairly new comfortable clean with polite and helpful staff and excellent catering. I've used it before departures on all of the three daily flights and always found a seat. There are hot and cold buffets (except early morning): the cold buffet is especially good. The kitchen will make food on request; if you want toast and eggs for breakfast they will oblige. As I don't drink alcohol comments and ratings for the drinks are limited the tea coffee water and soft drinks which are all very good. There are only two (men's) shower stalls but they have always both been free and immaculate and the staff supply a hotel style bundle of towels. Plenty of hot water and decent pressure. The only negative point is the wifi. The connection is usually fine but can be a tad slow and difficult to connect at times of high usage.,Manchester Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,Very small No wine or spirits on offer not a lot of food choice. Toilets outside of the lounge a few minutes walk away. Asked about wine and was told if I wanted it I had to go and buy it not good for someone who is travelling Business Class! Asked for a cup of tea which was produced without any milk asked for the milk none arrived so went back to ask again and the waitress was busy chatting to her friend and then finally acknowledged me.,Phuket Airport,1.0,1,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no
Emirates,Great Lounge in new terminal. Seated and services Dining free manicure or massage great showers and RR Drinks selection is out of this world.,Dubai Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,Very nice lounge as stated before this is a large terminal so be prepared to walk. Was there both times at breakfast times and didn't find it crowded nice choice of food wine spirits etc. Toilets and showers were very clean.,Dubai Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,Extremely disappointed with the lounge. Overcrowded. Not enough toilet facilities!!! Had to queue. forget about having a shower. Dreadful. Free WiFi did not work. Had to walk a long long way to get to it. Not worth it. Food once found was reasonable. Just far far too many people in the lounge. The worst part of the otherwise good Emirates experience by far.,Dubai Airport,3.0,2,4,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,no
Emirates,Shocked at Emirates service at BKK. Checked in 3 hours early looking forward to a superb end to our stay in Thailand. Spent 40 minutes searching for the (closed) lounge. No info from the airline or check in desk. Finally and by accident found it had been relocated to the utterly awful Qantas lounge no explanation just saw an Emirates employee and followed her! What little food was there was cold and inedible. Staff completely disinterested. Soup completely cold and yet butter sachets liquid! Qantas lounge was no better than a 1960s Barnsley railway waiting room. Only in 1964 the food was better and the staff nicer in a British Rail waiting room. Finally negotiated a transfer to another lounge where we mingled with several tattooed gentlemen in singlets and ate some cheese on white bread sandwiches. Well done Emirates! Good customer lost.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,2.0,1,2,3.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,no
Etihad Airways,"Lounge is small but a pleasant respite while waiting for ones flight. Food choices good, lounge was quiet and not very crowded. The staff were tremendous in keeping travelers informed of their flights, helpful suggestions about the terminal and went out of their way to accommodate travelers requests. ",New York JFK Airport,9.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,Good to explore as is huge. Food and bar sensational. Showers a nightmare. Showers downstairs were segregated fair enough but that meant only 4 showers available at any one time and a queue! When I complained I was directed to a in terminal hotel which had showers in a shower lounge. Not easy to find as not well signposted. Otherwise at 8am busy with people but service not affected. 1am again very very busy but access to food wine net was an ease.,Dubai Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,This is a large clean and comfortable lounge but the interior feels too open due to the airport terminal's tube-like design. It had many seating areas and was not crowded when I arrived after midnight on March 7. A menu service dining room is available and a few snacks were available near the bar. I would have preferred a buffet meal line as a supplement especially if one is in a hurry. Staff was courteous and meal service was prompt. The business center had many computer terminals and I was the only user at that time. This lounge is not modern with direct gate access like the one in Terminal A but it is a pleasant place to spend a few hours.,Dubai Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,The staff were polite and attentive although we were told the staff will personally come to us and remind us when it's time to board the flight - but they forgot.. Food was above average. We ended up boarding the flight as the last pax. Couldn't comment about the shower and business facilities as we didn't use them.,Melbourne Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Etihad Airways,Awful lounge. Don't waste your money. Not only was it empty but when I fell asleep they woke me up saying sleeping was not allowed! After I paid them several hundred dollars! This lounge is very noisy sub par food and service and I would have booked something else if I knew.,Abu Dhabi Airport,2.0,1,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,no
Etihad Airways,A very good lounge and service totally let down by stylish but uncomfortable seats and lack of toilets.,Abu Dhabi Airport,3.0,1,5,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,no
Etihad Airways,Very nice atmosphere and comfortable enough after I had to tell someone who roared into his phone to go into the closed off business area. I also told staff this should not be allowed and this is their job to look for and sort these issues. It is not the guest who should have to do this. Excellent A la carte table dining (for breakfast anyway). There is a buffet for fruits yogurts etc.,Dublin Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,yes
Emirates,The lounge is located above duty free shopping after the immigration clearance. The lounge is huge the staff didn't bother about giving a quick tour of the lounge as they were pretty busy. The lounge has a resting and a dinning area seats were comfortable but a bit noisy with lots of families with young children. Wide selection of drinks and bar snacks. They were serving lunch so there was soup and good spread of starters and mains. The desserts were excellent too. Overall the lounge was well maintained and comfortable.,Auckland Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,Excellent lounge spacious and well laid out. Great selection of food and drinks. This is better than any of Emirates lounges in Dubai.,London Gatwick Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,This was the lounge in the A380 terminal. The staff were faultless food good. Downside was the shower facilities… - slightly warm water (could not get it hot) and very basic (shower not enclosed little power in shower compared to lounges such as Asiana and other airlines). No massage chairs seemed to be available which is a shame. The staff are let down by the facilities which are simply not up to the standard one expects of a new Emirates lounge.,Dubai Airport,4.0,2,5,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,no
Etihad Airways,Excellent facilities and first class service. High quality food genuine service and comfortable environment. There appears to be only 1 shower in the ladies room and there is no place to recline while waiting for your flight.,Abu Dhabi Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Etihad Airways,Greeted by a polite well groomed man and directed into lounge with subdued lightening light coloured vinyl tub chairs and low partitions (top 3rd frosted glass). These are showing some signs of wear - quite uncomfortable. In one corner 4 cubicles with back-facing massage chairs and a beaded curtain for privacy. First Class area is the just a cordoned off back corner separated by a sign several plants. Food/beverages well below par. Tea preparation is separate from coffee. Array of teabags you find in any chain hotel room - only milk UHT. Coffee from machine worse than instant and tepid. Arrived at 9pm. Food almost depleted yet to be restocked. Tried a tomato/iceberg lettuce/hummus sandwich but it'd been so long it was in it's plastic bag it'd become soggy and the bread curled. Signs indicate hot vegetarian options where carrot soup and mashed potato. Several hot stew looking dishes and several Asian options. Six pcs with good internet speed. Along the entire window length a row of desks with individual reading lamps. Hospitality staff are pleasant. Female toilets: 2 cubicles 2 showers 2 hairdryers. Soap dispensers are the plastic type you buy in a supermarket. Extremely disappointing! I'm popping downstairs to grab a bite to eat.,Singapore Changi Airport,2.0,2,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,no
Etihad Airways,What a contrast to the terminal 1 lounge last July and the new lounge in Terminal 3 by gate 35. The new lounge is spacious high quality furnishings great bar plentiful supply of food. Only negative is that it appears to be quite focused on Indian hot foods. Staff very attentive didn't use the spa. I guess the previous reviewer is a 1st class customer and would expect a separate lounge other airlines. A huge improvement and is matched to the excellent lounge in Dublin. On Etihad you normally get redemption seats which you never get any more with Emirates.,Abu Dhabi Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,This is the only part of Dubai airport which is worth visiting. The lounge is comfortable there was a very wide selection of good hot and cold food drinks etc. I would be happy to revisit this place if I ever return to Dubai - but that isn't going to happen - one visit to Dubai is enough for anyone.,Dubai Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,Brisbane's Emirates lounge is pretty decent. We arrived late from Singapore en-route to Auckland. We had eight hours to catch our flight to Auckland so we decided to get comfy at the lounge. We were welcomed at the reception given a tour of the lounge and recommended a cozy corner to sleep. There were four showers well stocked with timeless spa products. After a morning shower we had a light breakfast. Internet speed was fine. The best part about the lounge is that you can board your A380 from the lounge itself.,Brisbane Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,Looks like a very posh lounge at the beginning. Almost deserted. Every gate has a separate boarding lounge with enough space to give everybody his own seating area with a coffee corner. And it looks very stylish. But that's it. I have been there a number of times and every time it was a very disappointing experience. If you want to use the shower be prepared to get into a sauna. The cold water is always warm and the very small shower rooms are humid. The aircon just isn't strong enough to keep the desert out. Unlike business you have to order almost any food and drinks. But the person who should be waiting on you seems never to be around. Or takes everything away but does not bother to ask if you want something else. Unlike business they only provide chairs for sitting. Not a bench or sofa in sight to lounge upon. This is a first class lounge. Unlike economy or business the boarding process is almost always delayed because the ground staff comes late to let you board the plane. All this has been mentioned to several duty managers. No change with the shower room temperature. Still not a bench or sofa to be seen. And the service remains a problem. The only thing that is cold are their excuses about this kind of service. A pity the business lounge is always crowed but it looks like a better place to stay. Less formal and more relaxed. And be prepared to walk a lot if you want to visit the shower and/or toilet. It is a huge lounge because it covers the whole building.,Dubai Airport,3.0,2,5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,no
Etihad Airways,Etihad have closed their existing business and First lounges in Terminal 3 and opened a new combined lounge (no separate First) near Gate 35 in Terminal 3. First impressions were that this is a high- quality lounge spacious and a lot more capacity than the existing lounge. Food and beverages on a par with existing buffet-style business lounges which are very good. Good business area and nice childrens area. Where this lounge really fails is the SiX Senses Spa which is shambolic. I have just queued for 65 minutes for a shower. They had no waitlist so you had to just grab a seat and wait (could not nip out to get food). They had a booking system for spa treatments but the earliest slot was over two hours later so most people could not avail of this. I use their First lounge normally as Gold Elite so the experience going through Abu Dhabi today is significantly worse than before. Lot of unhappy people here. I believe that when they renovate the old lounge area near the shops it will be a dedicated First lounge which will hopefully take the pressure off in this lounge. Poor experience overall.,Abu Dhabi Airport,2.0,3,3,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
Etihad Airways,Terminal 3: Arrived in 'Business' lounge at 0015. Every seat was occupied. Busier than a bus terminal and about as comfortable. Screaming children added to the misery. The lounge is way too small to seat the people paying a big premium for their ticket. Other bleary-eyed travellers were circling the lounge looking for seats constantly. Shag-pile carpet looks dirty couches worn and grubby. Unsatisfactory.,Abu Dhabi Airport,2.0,1,3,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,no
Etihad Airways,The moment I walked in I could see it was crowded big time and it was hard to find a place to sit. It is 1/20th smaller than emirates lounge in Dubai. Food a good spread and very efficient staff. Quiet room spacious but sleeping on couch is always painful for a tall guy. Washrooms cramped to the core and very small.,Abu Dhabi Airport,3.0,1,2,3.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,no
Emirates,This is a poor lounge. The environment is out if date and the snack offering is cellophane prepacked stuff.,Glasgow Prestwick Airport,3.0,3,3,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
Emirates,A very nice lounge to use with good staff service. Excellent fillet steak followed by tart citron cheese biscuits and coffee. Perfect to eat there as it is a late evening departure.,Sydney Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,Generally I fly with Singapore Airlines and now I know why. The business lounge although enormous was missing decent toilet and shower amenities. That is a huge disappointment and something you expect when flying business. The toilets were dirty and extremely run down. The showers were horrible and that's if you could be bothered waiting in line to use them. Completely disappointed by the new terminal business lounge.,Dubai Airport,2.0,4,1,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no
Etihad Airways,We did this lounge in Jan 2014 EY418 to KUL. One of the worst I ever been in space wise. I had to give my stool to a furlorn standing lass with a cup of coffee in her hand. My first on Etihad and what a disappointment for the hub airport. The lounge was so overcrowded. Will be travelling J again as Etihad are value for bucks but shall be researching for a alternative airport paid lounge for a convenient place to sit. Staff were doing the best they could given the incompetence and short sightness of Etihad. What a downer on Etihad offerings.,Abu Dhabi Airport,1.0,1,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Etihad Airways,Abu Dhabi Lounge Terminal 3. From the moment you get the lift/stairs to the entrance you feel like a Number. You don't feel special or the dollars you spent on a ticket was worth it. Its too busy Lounge is too small. The spa is brilliant as well as showers. I cannot fault customer service. The biggest problem are size of the lounge way too small. you feel cramped and enclosed. It didn't feel like a Business Class lounge of quality ie: Singapore Emirates Qantas British Airways.,Abu Dhabi Airport,4.0,3,4,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,no
Etihad Airways,Fantastic service and extremely nice people. Love the food and the care of the lounge staff.,Washington Dulles Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,Excellent Lounge. The food court is separated from the main sitting Area. Business center (internet etc) in a separate area. Decoration is a bit austere making the lounge looking like a bank! The men's bathroom was totally run down. One of the faucets had an out of order sign and so had one of the shower rooms. Looking into the shower in operations was totally run down with humidity patches on walls.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,This lounge is huge for this little number of passengers of one A380 in Munich. Very clean. A lot of different possibilities to sit or work. In the afternoon they offer a fantastic range of cold and hot food with a great selection of wine and other drinks. Champagne as well.,Munich Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,"Flying Australia to Ireland (or any number of European destinations) means you leave from creaky old terminal 2 when you change in Dubai. The Business Class lounge here is dreadful: shabby overcrowded and noisy. Going the other way you leave from Terminal 3 a new purpose-built A380 terminal. The lounge is almost as long as the terminal - departure gates for Business Class passengers are in the lounge. Not having to trek through the main concourse is a pretty good convenience. I arrived at the busy time just after midnight and left after a long layover at the next busy time just before 10am. In between the lounge was quiet spacious and very comfortable - especially the quiet area with loungers at the far end. (There were no PA announcements to disturb me for six hours as there were no flights). Even at the busy times the lounge wasn't crowded. There are two food service areas a lounge- like space on the left and a restaurant area hidden on the right with proper tables. Food and drink was okay in both areas if not inspiring. If you have a long layover at terminal 2 its worth using this lounge in terminal 3 and give yourself 20 minutes to get to the other terminal by the underground rail shuttle. One warning about Dubai Airport: ""duty free"" is a nonsense concept. The airport is a big shopping mall where everything is vastly overpriced.",Dubai Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Etihad Airways,This lounge is over crowed. No peace area. Lots of screaming kids. Very limit selection of food and drinks. Atmosphere is a sort of darkish. In general uncomfortable. Not to be recommended.,Brisbane Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no
Etihad Airways,The food and beverage selection was very extensive with several a la carte items offered. The staff was extremely courteous and eager to please. One employee in particular Nerlita went above and beyond to make sure I was well attended and provided superior customer service. I travel a lot for work and I have had the opportunity to visit many lounges- this one tops the list.,Washington Dulles Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Etihad Airways,Just relaxing in the Etihad lounge and the service is excellent as usual. The staff are helpful and friendly and nothing seems too much trouble. The quality of the food is amazing and I'd have no hesitation in recommending this lounge to others.,Manchester Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,The Business class lounge in Dubai is vast and has a similar feel to a motorway service station. There were plenty of seats available and a decent selection of drinks. A big minus is that there are not enough toilets available for the number of passengers.,Dubai Airport,3.0,3,3,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,no
Emirates,This was a great lounge with plenty of food and drink. The staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for me.,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,I use this lounge when departing from Birmingham as I am a Gold Skywards Member. I find this lounge to be an excellent start to any trip with Emirates. It is large spacious and the food on offer is always good. It ranges from snacks to hot or cold main meals with delicious desserts. A very adequate range of drinks is also on offer. The staff are extremely courteous and service is efficient and unobtrusive.,Birmingham Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Etihad Airways,Etihad use the SATS Premier Lounge in T2 at Changi. We had six hours in this lounge and found it to be better than a lot of airline lounges we have used. Greeted by friendly staff at reception. A huge selection of food was available that was well presented and kept fresh. Choices available from the bar were not so extensive. Staff cleared away dishes promptly. Clean washroom facilities. Excellent WiFi.,Singapore Changi Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Etihad Airways,One of the worst lounges in an airlines hub city you can imagine. The lounge is very small and was packed with people at 11pm  more people were coming in and simply walking out 3 of us eventually found a lounge chair but there was no real reason to be there. The toilets are very limited food selection was average at best and biggest problem is screens showing flights we could only see one which was only giving details in Arabic (even Tehran airport VIP lounge that Etihad uses has screens in two languages). No sign of any TV or other entertainment was in view in the corner we were located The internet was 3rd world standard slow. As we left we noticed they had opened the door to the first class lounge which had not a soul in it. Maybe there are quieter times but this really lets down Etihad's inflight standards.,Abu Dhabi Airport,2.0,1,3,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no
Etihad Airways,Due to our 1325 departure the lounge was not as busy as at other times of the day. However seeing this serves Etihad's T3 I can see how it's facilities can be put under pressure. There was no a la carte food offering just a hot/cold buffet. I asked a member of staff if they could make a little something up for our baby daughter and they obliged. In addition my wife asked if there was any dessert wine available (as there is on the plane) there wasn't but the gentleman behind the bar arranged for a glass to be brought through from the First Class lounge. The fifteen minute complimentary massage at the Six Senses Spa was very good. Unfortunately the children's room was not up to the standard of Heathrowe. Finally on using the baby change facility (disabled toilet) after washing our hands we discovered we could not dry them because there was no hand towel in the holder or hand dryer or paper towels.,Abu Dhabi Airport,3.0,3,4,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,Very disappointing to be honest. The seating and service from staff was great but like the business class lounge at this airport it was very noisy because the general concourse and duty free area on the floor below is open to both first and business class lounges in the centre and the noise travels up and in. The food was marginally better than the business class lounge but to get toast and butter you had to go into the dining room sit wait to be served and then wait for the toast. All a bit over the top. Toilets and showers were exactly the same as in the business class lounge. Champagne was a little better I was told but the diet coke tasted just the same.,Dubai Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,No towels for showers. Food is pre prepared salads and sandwiches. If you are booking a flight out of Rome choose another carrier.,Rome Fiumicino Airport,2.0,2,3,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,no
Emirates,Gate B lounge an extremely busy lounge even at midnight. Due to its design it was hard to see where empty seats were located so literally sat down in the first one I came to which wasn't particularly that comfortable. It was near a bar though and the staff there were very efficient in serving you. Empty glasses/bottles quickly cleared away by the waiting staff. I couldn't see where to get proper food so can't comment on that one. Toilets kept very clean and tidy. Good speed for wifi also. Gate A lounge a much better design/layout than its Gate B counterpart. While still busy there did seem to be a choice of seating available. Easy to see where food was being served and the breakfast items were ample. Staff here seemed to be going for efficiency than friendly. Unfortunately I couldn't get connected to the lounge wifi but managed to get connected to the general airport wifi for 30 precious minutes. Toilets spotlessly clean.,Dubai Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,yes
Etihad Airways,Plenty of space and facilities. We travelled on the 09:15 departure to Abu Dhabi with our seven month old daughter and made use of the (sound-proofed!) children's room. We had the a la carte breakfast and recommend the eggs benedict and pancakes. Hot and cold drinks regularly offered. There was a buffet with all the usual staples. The fifteen minute complimentary massage at the Six Senses Spa was a nice touch. Overall one of the better lounges we have used.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,yes
Etihad Airways,We used this lounge when travelling on Air Malta flights. London Heathrow lounge is excellent and in the opinion of my wife and myself is on a par if not better than the BA First Class (Concorde) Lounge at Heathrow T5. On entering the lounge we were given a warm welcome. We were there on a weekday morning between 08.45 to 11.00. There was an excellent breakfast (buffet and a la carte) with almost anything you could want. We found the spa in the to be readily available for chosen treatments. Although there is not a self-service bar for alcoholic drinks in the lounge there is a bar where passengers are served with alcoholic drinks. We have used the lounge twice (both times when travelling Air Malta Business Class) and have found the lounge and staff to be first rate.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Etihad Airways,Very large lounge but with limited refreshments on offer. Spa closed. Lots of staff cleaning tables but no table service. Soft drinks and beer available in fridges. Free wifi. If you want alcohol there is a small bar at the right hand side of the entrance which is easy to miss but they had no vodka left with no offer to replenish it. Wine served in half a glass. Quite disappointing lounge although it was quiet.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,4,5,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,I look forwards to visiting the Emirates lounge in Zurich Airport. Long walk but excellent food and wine. Average sized lounge but long trek to find it - however it is near the usual gate. One of the best lounges I have experienced. What a shame that they do not just buy a wifi modem and offer a decent service rather than that provided by the airport.,Zurich Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,Emirates Lounge in Hong Kong is small but never seems too crowded. Excellent choice of food hors d'oeuvres etc. Soft drinks beers Champagne wine. And the staff will make up a sandwich for you if you wish. HKG doesn't have fast track for business class. But not a problem. The problem with HKG is the arrival. Didn't check showers or wifi.,Hong Kong Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,Absolutely appalling. Very disappointing to find that Emirates is associated with this lounge. There is hardly any food except a small bowl of salad or a stale sandwich. Is this really the service we expected when choosing business class with one of the so called top airlines of the world? Makes you think about booking Emirates again.,Rome Fiumicino Airport,2.0,1,2,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,no
Etihad Airways,Table service for drinks and hot foods. Waitresses very attentive and polite. Only serving one flight so quite quiet lounge. Small buffet area for mezze cheeses etc. I had cream of celeriac soup with mushrooms and truffle oil! fillet of cod with black olive tapenade root veg purée and vegetables! washed down by several well-topped up glasses of champagne. Restaurant quality in taste quality and service. Own toilets not shared as in the other lounges there. A great start to a holiday indeed. Cannot be faulted.,Manchester Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,yes
Etihad Airways,Accessed as part of Gold card member benefits. The drink choices are high quality (excellent sauvignon blanc) - my only minor gripe would be the starter on the dining menu was slightly below the normal standard but an excellent main and dessert. Fast wifi good selection of papers plenty of seating make this my favourite lounge.,Manchester Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Etihad Airways,An excellent lounge probably the best for choice and quality of food. Abu Dhabi is the worst very overcrowded limited selection of food but staff good.,Dublin Airport,4.0,2,5,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,Business Class lounges in Concourse C - clean luxurious superb service excellent amenities great food wine drinks and juices. The new Business Class Lounge in Concourse A is a mega lounge with several mini-lounges and integrate boarding gates within the mini-lounges. Concourse A is for the use of A380s and has 25 gates. While there is a main dining and lounge area the idea is really to go to the mini-lounge area closest to your gate. Each mini-lounge has a wonderful spread of food drinks coffee machines wines etc. The food is great. Four vegetarian and four non-vegetarian options and salads breads and appetizers. There is a place to take a shower and it has all the amenities. There is also a Timeless Spa [paid I think]. The lounge is designed to seat close to 2000 people.,Dubai Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,The best Emirates Lounge that I have visited. Relatively small the staff are welcoming and helpful no matter. A superb selection of drinks and hot and cold food is backed up by efficient clearing of plates and polite staff who make the stay as comfortable as possible.,Brisbane Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,It seems there is a new lounge under construction in the B terminal. The temporary lounge is a hot mess. It is just a section of the upper floor of the airport that has been blocked off to give a pretence of a lounge. It is loud (constant airport-wide announcements.) hot poor ventilation and messy. The staff are spread out over too large an area and cannot cope with the scope of effort required. Dirty plates cups and tables abound but the seat-hungry business traveler doesn't care and takes any port in a storm. Emirates should have brought on extra staff but chose not to. The staff are friendly but management is asking too too much. The lounge in the A terminal is in good repair and should be used instead of the B terminal. Waiting at the actual gate is more relaxing.,Dubai Airport,2.0,1,1,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,no
Etihad Airways,The buffet food choices were more varied and better quality than last visit - thai green curry and chicken in red wine sauce were both very good. For a pay on entry lounge (I access as Etihad guest gold card holder) the drink brands are always good quality - using Johnny Walker Green label as their standard mixing whiskey (something of a waste but not complaining!). The main problems with this lounge is that it does get very busy at peak times and woefully inadequate bathroom facilities. Good wifi newspaper selection and bbc world news on tv.,Abu Dhabi Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,yes
Etihad Airways,Shower and toilet can become a nightmare. Just one shower and one toilet. No cleaning between guests no waiting list - if you want to take a shower you'll have to wait in line in the toilets! A nightmare! Wrote several times to Etihad probably others did never saw an improvement. Make sure there are towels before you start!,Abu Dhabi Airport,2.0,2,2,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,no
Etihad Airways,Visited this lounge on 6 different occasions in last month. It is by far one of the worst I have used. On a number of occasions I had to sit on the floor due to overcrowding. Etihad have two lounges here and both are as bad as each other. There is no booking system for a shower so it can be impossible to get one. Others mention the food as being great - I disagree food on the plane in business class is far better. The staff are good. In my travels with Etihad I would say that their Dublin lounge is the best I have used so far. You can order proper meals there but you cannot at their home lounges.,Abu Dhabi Airport,3.0,2,4,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,no
Emirates,"Sprawling lounge with excellent food and drink but it was crowded even at midnight. Major design flaw in that the designated ""quiet zone"" packed with lounges and beds is the noisiest part of the lounge with very loud announcement speakers and noise from the terminals below. Very difficult to get any sleep in the lounge even after midnight.",Dubai Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,A nightmare - a long queue to get in and then - ten minutes queue for the ladies toilet. A big queue for coffee and snack. No free tables/chairs. Used plates everywhere not cleared away. Noise level dreadful. No chance of getting a shower for a couple of hours. If you can avoid.,Dubai Airport,2.0,1,1,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,no

Etihad Airways,Lounge provided for gold and silver frequent flyers available for other airlines and payment. Small dull normally overcrowded uncomfortable and inadequate toilet facilities.,Abu Dhabi Airport,3.0,2,2,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,no
Etihad Airways,Food is great and bar staff are friendly and efficient. The problem is that it is way too small to handle the passenger flow. Can be difficult or near impossible to get a seat. Toilet facilities are very cramped and totally inadequate for the number of passengers they have to handle.,Abu Dhabi Airport,4.0,3,5,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Etihad Airways,This is the Air New Zealand lounge shared by Etihad. The staff was vaguely interested the food choice very limited and very very average. There was no shower gel nor shampoo in the showers the shower mixer was broken resulting in nearly boiling water pouring from the shower head. When complained to the head of the staff I heard that how could they no if guests did not report implying there is no cleaning between the guests! All together terrible experience despite very good service on board though. Will not come back again.,Sydney Airport,2.0,3,2,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,no
Emirates,We used the first class lounge twice recently and one of the best lounge experiences we have had. We had a late night snack of Sushi and drinks outward and a Champagne Breakfast on the return. Both were excellent and served by efficient staff. Boarding was direct from the lounge which was excellent.,Dubai Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,The lounge at Birmingham is quite new and well run with a decent selection of food and drinks. Generally a pleasant and comfortable environment to spend a few hours waiting for your flight.,Birmingham Airport,4.0,4,4,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,My 3rd time but this time everything changed and downgraded. As per previous reviews I was very disappointed with Dubai Business Lounge very overcrowded no hot food meal options only cold buffet snack type foods.,Dubai Airport,3.0,2,3,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,no
Etihad Airways,Very attentive and friendly staff restaurant food plenty of it great wifi and comfortable seating. Showers and bathrooms spotless.,Abu Dhabi Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Etihad Airways,Used the Etihad Pearl Business Lounge at Abu Dhabi T3 while connecting from a MCT-AUH flight to AUH-MAN in business. Between these two flights the lounge was a huge disappointment particularly with this being Etihad Airways home airport. The lounge was crowded so there were no comfortable seats available the food was okay but lacked choice (four of six hot options were available) - and the toilets were filthy.,Abu Dhabi Airport,3.0,1,3,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,no
Etihad Airways,Further to my previous post Sep 2011 this lounge has improved. It's still an awkward walk from T3 to T1 but I was pleasantly surprised how improved the lounge was. There is now a newspaper and magazine rack the food selection now has a lot more to offer including cold cuts of meat and various cheeses. A bigger selection of hot ( warm) dishes various teas and coffees and a lot more seating arrangements ( previously the middle and lower tier sections were closed off ) . The washrooms are a little small but a hot shower is available. A well stocked bar with waiter service is a nice touch. On a minus note there didn't seam to be any computers available. Overall a very pleasant experience and would recommend to all.( shame you still have to walk into T1 for a smoke though).,Abu Dhabi Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,Shabby crowded poor catering. Overall very disappointed with the complete experience. Showers looked shabby and water was cold on both my outbound sector and inbound.,Dubai Airport,2.0,1,3,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,no
Emirates,What a Dungeon! Never expected this from Emirates. To pay almost 8500K on a ticket and to be thrown in a lounge that has no natural lighting is overcrowded with limited selection of food and drink is disgraceful. One bite of a sandwich that was stale and we packed up and walked out. We felt much better sitting around like randoms in the general airport area.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,1.0,1,2,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,no
Emirates,"Still a few teething problems but they are trying hard. Signage is difficult to find so everyone has stopped at the first seating area which is packed - while the rest of the lounge is quite empty. Also the constant boarding announcements for flights departing other parts of the airport are bit annoying - they should only announce flights in Concourse A. The lounge ""looks"" great but is a bit style over function. For example tables are difficult to sit and eat at chairs not too comfy.",Unknown,4.0,3,5,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Etihad Airways,In terminal 1 about 10 minutes walking from terminal 3. Have always found this lounge to be clean and less crowded than the actual Etihad business class lounge in terminal 3. Staff extremely helpful and friendly. Same food and drinks as in the business lounge.,Abu Dhabi Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,5.0,yes
Etihad Airways,"This is the Air New Zealand lounge shared by Etihad. Who on earth decided to use wickerwork rattan armchairs for the ""comfort"" of travellers who sometimes have to spend hours waiting for a connecting flight - the armrests alone are uncomfortable enough but add in the punishment to the seating area penetrating through the cushion. The only other viable seating is of a benching type so no armrests - but on balance preferable! The food choices were very limited and as such I was not hungry enough to assess the quality.",Melbourne Airport,3.0,2,4,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,no
Etihad Airways,If you are a silver or gold card holder flying in economy class this lounge is now allocated to you. However this lounge is located in terminal 1 and as most people transit in terminal 3 I don't think it's worth the 20+ minute walk to use what is generally a sub standard facility. I wouldn't pay to use this facility and would rather sit in Starbucks at my own expense.,Abu Dhabi Airport,2.0,2,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,no

Emirates,I agree with other reviewers that the Dubai lounge is poor. It has no ambience and is crowded. We also noticed that people hog seats. We were not hungry and didn't eat much but the food quality seems OK.,Dubai Airport,3.0,2,3,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,no
Emirates,The lounges at Heathrow and Colombo are excellent. At Heathrow boarding is direct from the lounge which is comfortable. The food and drink are excellent. In Colombo the lounge is very relaxing. It has an excellent range of food and drink and service could not be better.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes

Etihad Airways,Extremely disappointing. Limited choice of food In fact there were on two varieties of tuna rolls on offer along with corn chips and pretzels. Nothing else. My wife and I were traveling to Sydney and had a four hour layover between connecting flights and while the peace and quiet of the lounge was welcomed the lack of food was not.,Paris CDG Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,Had to wait 5hrs for connecting Emirates business flight. Lounge large but not enough toilets and not very clean either. Long queues which I would not expect in business class lounge. Wondering how Emirates manages when they are ordering so many new aircraft and cannot cope with the present business class lounge.,Dubai Airport,4.0,4,3,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,no
Emirates,Citibank and AMEX offer the use of this lounge as a benefit to having their cards but it isn't much of a benefit when you can't find a seat to sit in. I have used this lounge in the past and it has been pretty handy. The last time we couldn't find anywhere to sit- not that it bothered the staff at all. People often hold empty seats for others with their cabin luggage that remain empty for hours. Other people use it as a hotel and sleep on two chairs. The Wifi doesn't work very well although there are some computers there that are popular. The food and beverages on offer are pretty good but the one shower needs a makeover and there seems to be corrosive gunk on all the fittings in the washroom that really should have been taken care of years ago. The furniture has taken a moderate beating and has been there since day one. The concept is great but it has become a victim of it's own success needing refurbishment enlargement and some better standards.,Dubai Airport,2.0,1,2,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Etihad Airways,The lounge was too far from the terminal. The food was not really that hot. The fruits and beverages was ok. The staff told us wifi was going to be fixed soon but I waited for almost 2 hours and still none. Accommodating staff great six sense spa offer but it was so limited - I was only allowed to use 1 treatment instead of at least 2.,Abu Dhabi Airport,3.0,3,4,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,no
Etihad Airways,This lounge is overcrowded and very noisy. Food good great service but we were there from 2100 to 0240 and it gradually got worse with a number of people standing up and not being able to get a seat at all. I do not agree with the idea of asking people traveling in economy to use another lounge. I will in future organise my connections so I can limit time in this lounge.,Abu Dhabi Airport,4.0,3,4,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,no
Emirates,The Dubai Business Class lounge is not big enough for the number of passengers using it so it is difficult to find a seat. There are long queues for the toilets. If you have more than a couple of hours in the lounge then it feels a lot lot longer as the seats are not good for relaxing with very few foot stools. The food options are limited. At least there is free Wi-Fi.,Dubai Airport,2.0,2,3,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,no
Emirates,This shared lounge is very poor. Although there is enough space (a small room allocated to Emirates First Class) the food and drink selection is small. Food is not made to order and runs out quickly. This lounge is shared by so many airlines and card holders that it does not feel special. As a First Class passenger I feel the old lounge shared with South African Airways was so much better. Sadly this has now closed.,Cape Town Airport,3.0,3,4,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
Emirates,Quiet comfortable and relaxing. A good variety of hot and cold food and excellent selection of beverages. It is enhanced by the fact that all of the EK flights from Gatwick are B777s (rather than A380s) meaning that there will never be more than 40 people in there at any one time. The reception staff are helpful and wait until the queue at the departure gate has cleared before calling the flight meaning that you can leave the lounge and get straight on to the plane.,London Gatwick Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Etihad Airways,As a silver card member I'm entitled to access to the Al Reem lounge at Abu Dhabi. I can't compare it to the Pearl lounge in T3 (I've never accessed it) but as a business class lounge it was good with plenty of breakfast options available stocked and manned bar area plenty of seating (if in a somewhat weird 3 tiered room) and newspapers and magazines available. However Wi-Fi was unavailable whilst I was there (and the staff couldn't fix it) and there was only 3 staff to man the bar clear plates and update the breakfast area and thus they struggled to keep up with demand in a less than half full lounge. The only real problem is the lack of toilet facilities in the lounge for its size.,Abu Dhabi Airport,3.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,yes
Etihad Airways,Small but uncrowded lounge. Quality of service food and drink during my stay was excellent. Free wifi and tv/newspapers available. The criticism would be the lack of a sleeping zone but few lounges of this size would be likely to have that. Definitely much better than either the Al Reem lounge in AUH.,Manchester Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Etihad Airways,Previously Etihad gold and silver card holders used the Pearl business lounge in terminal three complete with comfy seats and smoking room but now (due to overcrowding) have to use the Al Reem lounge in the old terminal 1. All Etihad flights to Europe and Asia arrive and leave from the new T3 so this becomes awkward. On arrival you have to bypass security and walk (10 mins) to the old terminal and the lounge. This lounge is not a patch on the T3 lounge with a very limited food selection (drinks are fine). There is no comfortable seating area and no papers to pass the time. The next problem is there is no smoking room so you must use the smoking room in the far corner of T1. Then of course to catch your flight head back to T3 and go through security which becomes more of a muddle if another flight arrives as you do - as nobody knows where they are going and can cause another delay.,Abu Dhabi Airport,3.0,2,3,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,no
Emirates,This is the best lounge I have been to in Australia/New Zealand there is very little to fault apart from the distance from customs/immigration. Great food with enormous selection of both hot and cold choices and friendly but unobtrusive service. Good selection of reading material. Natural light and views of the tarmac and gates with very comfortable decor. Bathrooms top notch. with great amenity kits and more than adequate business facilities. Added bonus of being able to board your flight direct from the lounge.,Brisbane Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,Overcrowded hot and not really that pleasant. The food on offer was nice enough but the crowds of people made me want to get out of there fast.,Dubai Airport,4.0,3,3,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,no
Emirates,So much more pleasant than the crowded horror that is the Business Class Lounge. The First Class Lounge is an oasis of calm. Excellent food staff and facilities.,Dubai Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Etihad Airways,Quite a small but pleasant lounge. Nice reception from the staff and frequent offer to refill drinks and so forth. As it was an early flight we enjoyed a cooked to order breakfast. Very good. You could also help yourself to cold cuts and bakery if you didn't want a cooked meal.,Abu Dhabi Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Etihad Airways,"We were flying First Class Etihad-Europe having previously travelled First Class on Qantas BA Air France and Emirates. The lounge turns out to be the New Zealand Airlines ""standard"" lounge. This is very much not what we expect when we pay for First Class. It's a nice enough lounge crowded despite a quiet night at the airport (I'd hate to see it on a slightly busy night!) but nothing more. Would not reach Business Class standards for any other airline. As we sit in the lounge we are not planning to fly Etihad again. There's a chance for catch up on the flights and in the other ports but really we've made a decision to fly First Class because we want ""First Class"" funnily enough! This is not a First Class lounge and as stated above I'd be disappointed if I'd paid Business Class for this. Part of the real pleasure of starting a holiday is sitting back in the lounge with that first glass of champagne. We last travelled Emirates and while they didn't have a dedicated First lounge (shared with Business) the facilities food and champagne are great on board. This is the first time I've ever bothered to write such a review which reflects our disappointment. Etihad has a fair bit of catching up to do at this early stage. There's no way that we'll depart Melbourne with Etihad again. Do what Air France do escort your First Class passengers (in CDG at least) to the lounge make sure they're comfortable and come and get them when it's time to leave. If you're going to ask for 5-10 times the fare make the customer feel a little special!",Abu Dhabi Airport,2.0,3,3,3.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,no
Etihad Airways,Etihad business class travellers have to fight for seats in this lounge. This lounge is too small and regularly too full to accommodate all business class passengers. Food quality has declined.,Abu Dhabi Airport,4.0,3,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no
Emirates,The location is convenient in terms of being next to the boarding gate but it is a trek away from the shops etc. The lounge is a common one for first and business class and has ample seating. The display of food is impressive and the it is all halal. Toilets and showers available as well as free internet access. Overall an excellent lounge.,Beijing Capital Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,The lounge is smart with comfortable seats but air conditioning was not on and the lounge was very uncomfortable. A group of passengers got very loud and were becoming a distraction and disturbing other passengers. When brought to the attention of the staff they were not interested. Food and drinks were adequate several TVs.,Mauritius Airport,4.0,3,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,yes
Emirates,Pleasant comfortable lounge. Ai conditioned unlike gate lounges upstairs. Good selection of small food and beverage. TV internet showers if required. Shared with other airlines but not crowded when we were there.,Dar Es Salaam Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Etihad Airways,Totally disappointed by this so called premium lounge. Not only was it overcrowded the staff offered no help when you are circling around trying to find a place to sit and eat. The staff at reception was fine. The toilets seemed too small for volume of passengers and I looked for the so called shower facilities in vain. The whole design on top of the huge crowd using it certainly gives you the impression that you are in a canteen and not in a premium lounge. On the return flight the plane from Kuala Lumpur landed in Abu Dhabi around midnight and not only trying to find the lounge from where you got off this time was a nightmare but when I got to the lounge I did not bother to eat (despite being hungry) as I was not prepared to explore every corner just to find a comfortable place to eat. Etihad please wake up and upgrade this lounge I am not being demanding but when you pay to travel business class some comfort in transit is not too much to ask.,Abu Dhabi Airport,2.0,1,3,3.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,no
Etihad Airways,Senses Spa would be one of the best things here. Lounge is too small for the morning traffic. Food was good and a variety. Staff is too loud. Waiting for the shower and a line for the toilet - never happened with me before in a Business class lounge. Etihad people need to understand what a lounge means - and not just free food and drinks.,Abu Dhabi Airport,3.0,3,3,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,no

Emirates,The first time I have used this new lounge and a great improvement from the shared lounge that Emirates used before. The lounge is not that easy to find. It is located near the arrival desks on the left hand side via a lift to the 3rd floor. Once found it is clean only thing missing is a smoking area. Food excellent but limited choice of drinks but for Sri Lanka this is heaven and compared to the shared lounge is a real treat. Staff friendly and helpful.,Colombo Airport,4.0,5,5,3.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,Severely over crowded queues for showers and wcs. Noisy and as previously described like a street market. Not what we expect as a business customer. Didn't bother attempting the showers on the return leg. Enough of a problem to over ride any of Emirates' other benefits.,Dubai Airport,2.0,2,3,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,no
Etihad Airways,This is not an Etihad lounge as they do not have one at JFK. This lounge is so poor it is unbelievable unhappy person on reception only one person cleaning up the food way below lounge level no champagne warm white wine. We left as soon as possible. Avoid this place it really is very bad.,New York JFK Airport,1.0,2,2,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,no
Etihad Airways,Rather small feeling crammed and very crowded. It was difficult to find a seat and impossible to use one of the computer terminals. Staff were busy in their attempts to replenish food and beverages. The lounge needs to be much bigger.,Abu Dhabi Airport,3.0,3,3,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
Etihad Airways,Although this is the new lounge in Terminal 3 it can get very crowded. Food and beverage is good but seating is a little close together and there is not much privacy. The Six Senses Spa is great. Overall not a bad lounge but I do not know why Etihad chose to create such a small lounge in contrast to the number of people who use it. Etihad needs to attend to the washrooms as they were not what you would expect from a business class lounge.,Abu Dhabi Airport,4.0,3,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no
Emirates,Far too small for the number of passengers. What idiot calculated that 10 urinals would be sufficient for the hundreds of male passengers? Queuing in the cramped sweaty lavatory is NOT what you want after a 14 hour flight from Brisbane. The whole lounge is a disaster area and quite a joke after reading the Emirates web-site description.,Dubai Airport,3.0,2,3,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,no
Emirates,Use the lounge about twice a month. It is now becoming apparent that it is not First Class. The wooden furniture is damaged (chipped and scratched) and the upholstered furniture dirty and worn. It is very noisy with all the announcements from the departure hall below and this lounge must have the worst wifi on the planet. The staff are friendly and helpful and selection of food and beverages are generally good. However I found the Lounge in T1 (currently closed) far more superior giving a much greater feeling of elegance privacy and exclusivity. It is much smaller with almost no sound interferences.,Dubai Airport,2.0,2,1,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,no
Emirates,Stopped off here on our way to Auckland in Feb 2011. Very pleasant lounge with selection of snack foods and drinks. Very attentive service who supplied good coffee as and when required. Quite a few people in but still nice and relaxed. When our flight was called we more or less boarded straight from the lounge - nice touch.,Brisbane Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,yes
Etihad Airways,The a la carte dining was superb with great attention by the staff. Again the Six Senses Spa is great and just what you need before a long flight. The food and beverage section is well maintained and is of a high quality. Overall this is a fine lounge and rates as one of the best I have been in.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,no
Etihad Airways,Excellent catering and drinks selection complete with bar service. Abundant large screen iMacs for use as well as Wi-fi. Well-kept though few toilets with a single shower so there can be a queue. There is a Six Senses Spa which gives complimentary 15 minute treatments with free clothes pressing. Inside the Spa are 6 more showers. The rush hour seems to be from 8-9 am. It was virtually empty before and after that.,Abu Dhabi Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,no
Emirates,Used this lounge twice March 2011 on our way to and from New Zealand. Quiet spacious and clean with endless supplies of beverages and food and restaurant area. Very comfortable sofas if required. Excellent facility well worth using except why are the showers outside the Lounge? And why are the toilets separate from the showers ? You have to exit and walk quite a way before locating the Shower Room (which frankly could do with sprucing up).,Dubai Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,This is a new lounge a huge improvement. The facility was immaculate and offered nice views with comfortable chairs excellent food separate dining area well designed toilets and business centre. Lounge staff attentive and friendly though the reception staff member on duty seemed more interested in chatting on her mobile phone than being attentive.,Colombo Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,A new lounge we did not know existed. Very Welcome .Staff very welcoming. Everything clean and spotless and food and beverage selection excellent. Good scenic views of the Bosphorous and airport.,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,Outstanding staff and first rate food and beverage. The bathrooms offer hot showers. Free wifi and champagne with canapes was an ideal way to start a flight.,Auckland Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Emirates,Transit time around 2.5 hours and went to main Business Lounge. Not too difficult to find seat for 2 people. Internet speed is extremely slow which I had to give up eventually.,Dubai Airport,3.0,4,3,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,yes
Emirates,Probably the dirtiest lounge I have ever been to even touching the fridge door to get a drink was unpleasant. The carpets are dirty the available cutlery not clean tables were not wiped old plates with dried food and drinks everywhere. Rubbish baskets overflowing. A soup was available some time during the day but the dish was practically empty with dried left over in and around it. A couple of sandwiches in plastic and some apples. Coffee no tea. Water and coke and 2 more soft drinks were available. Toilets smell bad broken and only one had a bit of toilet paper.,Sao Paulo Guarulhos Airport,1.0,1,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no
Emirates,Apart from the fact it's too big and impersonal there are only two shower rooms and the wi-fi is ridiculously slow. Brisbane has as many showers for only 2 flights a day. It's enough for me to move to another airline.,Dubai Airport,2.0,2,4,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no
Emirates,Compares more than favourably with the Air New Zealand lounge. Pity there was no info on joining Skywards and the lounge staff gave us incorrect info which resulted in us not being credited with miles for the flight.,Auckland Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,I normally use the main business lounge but a 15 minute walk from the main transfer area came across this smaller lounge near gate 122. I arrived at 2300 and found only 8 other passengers there. Food and drink selection seemed good. Excellent wifi. Quite a long way to walk to my gate - however more than compensated by this excellent little lounge.,Dubai Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,Disappointing experience. In spite of reasonably good food and a spacious layout the Emirates T3 lounge disappoints - at arrival at 4AM in the morning seating was widely available but around 6AM passengers clearly surpassed the lounge's capacity. WiFi became slow and signal dropped repeatedly access to basic food required waiting in line longer than acceptable toilets and showers were constantly full. I support other reviews about the inadequate layout of bathrooms and showers - the lounge is simply not good enough for a 4-star airline when showers and bathrooms do not have cold water water pressure is pesky and you have to wait in line for a free bathroom.,Dubai Airport,3.0,5,5,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,I was very impressed with the service and food - well run clean and enjoyable visit. A shame they do not use the same food and quality on the planes.,Dubai Airport,4.0,5,4,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,no
Emirates,Who in their right minds would not put toilets in with the shower facilities. You go to have a shower - then you walk in thinking you would go to the toilet first. You are then told toilet facilities are down the hall somewhere - outside the shower facilities. This must have been designed by a lunatic. The food is nothing near as good as the old business class lounge. Usually it is cold and dry - in the numerous times I have used this lounge the food has been really dreadful. Very disappointing.,Dubai Airport,3.0,4,3,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,no
Emirates,I have used this lounge about 7 times this year. As a smoker I thank Emirates for providing a smoking area. The staff were excellent - I have yet to try the A la Carte dinning as I only spend about one hour in the lounge. I would like to have trolleys for passengers when leaving the lounge as sometimes its a long way to the gates and secondly a larger selection of drinks.,Dubai Airport,4.0,5,5,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,no
Emirates,LGW is by far the better of Emirates London airport Lounges and the food was better than their DXB Lounges (which is not hard) or any of their SE Asia Lounges. Excellent food and drinks choices several TV's plenty Internet access a very spacious and comfortable lounge with professional and courteous staff. Excellent all round.,London Gatwick Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Emirates,Very nice new lounge for Emirates at the Mumbai airport. I think it is the first dedicated lounge EK has set up in India. In the past Emirates biz/first passengers used the Clipper lounge at Mumbai airport shared by many other airlines so this is a welcome change. Used the lounge around 8 am while waiting for my 9:55 am flight to Dubai. Not to crowded took a seat some reading material and got a cappuccino. Separate dining and seating areas. There were Indian and international breakfast items available in the buffet but somehow it seemed to early to eat and had a nice business breakfast to look fwd to on the flight so skipped eating here. Decent bathrooms with 2 showers also a nice touch. Toiletries and towels available.,Mumbai Airport,3.0,4,4,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,no
Emirates,Emirates have produced a lounge of exceptional comfort and service. The new lounge offers comfortable seating good business services and excellent food and drinks - the style follows Emirates other lounges.,Birmingham Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,no
Emirates,It could be a good lounge is a little more thought went into it. I have got over the vastness of it and strange layout meandering over the first floor of the terminal. The downsides are the overcrowded and impersonal greeting at the reception the poor shower facilities and slow internet service. Upside is the good food and extensive beverages on offer.,Dubai Airport,3.0,4,3,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,no
Emirates,We arrived at 7am and found a very nice space in which to spend an hour or so. Its not an intimate lounge and the toilet count is poor but it is generally light and airy breakfast food court was excellent and the flight announcement was well timed.,Dubai Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,no
Emirates,Its a fair trek from the main T3 concourse but once found was a very nice space in which to spend an hour before boarding. All the facilities one would expect including an excellent and well serviced food court and bar. Very helpful and attentive staff. Direct boarding of the aircraft from the lounge was the final bonus.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,5,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
Emirates,Disappointing - felt the lounge in the old terminal was better. In the T3 lounge no comfortable areas to sit - tip go to the furthest end of the lounge in front of the kids area as its quieter there if you need to rest. A very confusing lounge - certainly not a business lounge at all more like a waiting room with free food - which costs you the price of a business ticket!,Dubai Airport,4.0,3,4,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
Emirates,Very disappointing. Difficult to find somewhere to sit chairs not comfortable for long waits food disappointing - I am not into stew and casserole type dishes at 6am not very much on offer only muffins. As with other parts of the airport only hot water dispensed from taps in rest rooms had to go and get bottled water so that I could clean my teeth. Some serious thought needs to be given to the layout and service.,Dubai Airport,3.0,2,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no
Emirates,It was spacious clean bright well air-conditioned with ample seating a wide choice of good quality food and drink and helpful staff. It is vast and if people take the trouble to walk beyond the initial seating area they will find ample seating at both tables and of the armchair variety. During the 8 hours we spent there (from 6.30am - 2.30pm) we sat in a section of the lounge (approximately 30 arm-chairs and a 'cafeteria' area of approx 100 chairs) with only 4 other people.,Dubai Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,no
Emirates,Very impressed with Lounge facilities food/drink presentation and Staff. Makes for a great start for a long flight when you can relax and enjoy quality pre-flight ambience. This was our introduction to Emirates and we were very pleased with the experience. Have since tried other Lounges in Dubai and Paris and would rate the Brisbane Lounge as the best.,Brisbane Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Emirates,I have been in terrible lounges in some terrible airports that are quieter and better laid out than Emirates Terminal 3 lounge. I have on some occasions chosen not to even use the facilities as they are so poor. I take the walk and go back to the old lounges in the older terminal. At least it is quieter and does not have a hundred people queuing for every service.,Dubai Airport,3.0,1,3,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,no
Emirates,The lounge is combined F & C class and quite spacious with lots of seating options. A warm welcome by staff at the front desk. Lots of food options as well as Champagne. Bathrooms were clean and tidy. One downer is that there are no windows but this is the way AKL airport is set out. When ready for boarding we were escorted to the gate and the airbridge to the upper deck. A very nice experience.,Auckland Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,5.0,no
Emirates,A nice and cosy lounge similar to AKL but with windows. Morning departure so I didn't sample the booze but the espresso was excellent. A lot of reading materials staff friendly and welcoming and escorted us to the gate when boarding. Is it just me or are the Emirates Ground Staff doing a better job than their cabin crew.,Sydney Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,5.0,no
Emirates,An excellent lounge every bit the equal of Emirates lounge at Gatwick. If anything the food quality was marginally superior to Gatwick.,Brisbane Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
Emirates,A badly designed linear cafeteria which is noisy and stuffy. There appears to be a deliberate attempt to minimise the amount of comfortable seating. As for the showers there aren't enough of them for the volume of passengers and the water is limited to a trickle. The old lounge was marginally better than the new one. Compared to the Emirates lounge in Gatwick and Singapore this Dubai lounge is a disgrace.,Dubai Airport,2.0,1,3,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,no
Emirates,Dreadful place. arrived at 5am to find people sleeping across comfortable seats covered with blankets. I complained about this to a security guard and he said they shouldn't be doing it and he would wake them up. Joke. About an hour later I went to the desk and told the girls that this was unacceptable and they again said it was not allowed. But I pointed to one chap who was in their line of vision who had been sprawled out when we arrived and he was still there. They said they would go round and wake them up. We left to board an hour later and he and others were still asleep. My neighbour complained about this happening a month ago and got a reply from customer services saying this sleeping across seats was going to be stopped. Obviously has not. Where have all the people come from who now use this lounge?,Dubai Airport,1.0,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Emirates,This is simply the worst Business Class lounge I have ever used. It is a chaotic mass of economy class over-spill. I had a 10 hour wait for my flight during which time I expected to relax complete some work and enjoy some quiet time. How wrong I was! On entering the lounge 98% of seating was occupied with people fast asleep draped over the settees and arm chairs all surrounded by mountains of hand luggage. A number of strategically placed screaming babies adding to the feeling of misery which was soon to be magnified by the stampede of bodies pushing and shoving to get to the main snack area and fill their plates with as much food as possible. Poor manners and attitude appear to be the accepted norm within this facility and you soon realise there's not much difference between here and downstairs on the main concourse (In fact Burger King was quieter!). Another side issue is the Wi-Fi facility - My dial-up connection in 1999 was far far quicker! I pay a little extra to enjoy a little more exclusivity and comfort offered by Business Class - it's non-existent at Dubai's Emirates Business Lounge in fact to be accurate it's awful!,Dubai Airport,1.0,0,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,no
Emirates,Lounge full no room to sit - very noisy. Toilets a disgrace staff totally unconcerned. Really disappointed with this terminal.,Dubai Airport,1.0,2,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,no
Emirates,This was our first time in the new T3 Business lounge and it was a disappointment. It didn't feel anything special and was quite crowded. The lounge just doesn't feel like a business class lounge - more like a waiting room. We didn't see much food on offer just hot / cold drinks muffins fruit ice cream. We didn't want to lose our seats so we didn't really get to see a lot of the lounge or what food might have been on offer. All in all not the best in business lounges by a long shot definitely needs some re-thinking and re-planning.,Dubai Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,no
Emirates,This was our second time in this lounge and it was just as good as the first visit. Lovely spacious lounge with lot's of good comfortable seating. The choice of food was good with a selection of hot & cold dishes plus snacks coffee & full bar.,London Gatwick Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Jet Airways,"Disgusting. This can't even be called a lounge. Next time I was at the airport (July 2015) I did not even visit it. Also the staff is rude and inefficient. Better not to have this lounge as it is used by all airlines, and it actually is a misrepresentation of the airline, or card company offering access.",Pune Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,3.1,1.0,1.0,no

Jet Airways,The shared airline lounge at the new international terminal in Mumbai was excellent. Elevator down one level after you enter the reception lobby to the business class lounge area. Plenty of comfortable seating in a variety of configurations lounge chairs sofas eating tables with chairs and work stations with outlets. The free WiFi was reliable and fast but the logon process is a little tricky. Separate food bar and lounge areas. The food area had a very comprehensive buffet both Western and Indian food one of the best I have seen second only to Dubai. Lots of snacks and fruit which you could take with you for your flight. The bar had a full wall video screen showing sports and a wide selection of beer wine and cocktails. There were also private work rooms for business calls and shower facilities.,Mumbai Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Jet Airways,We took a Jet Airways domestic flight from Kolkata Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Airport (CCU) to Delhi (DEL) in business class. At check in we received an invitation to visit the lounge. Lounge was a complete disappointment. Apart of coffee/tea and soft drinks you had to pay for drinks! I’m a Star Alliance Gold member and visited lots of lounges everywhere but paying for drinks when you already pay the premium for flying business class is just unbelievable! I never had this experience before. Food options were very limited as well and for western style food the only option was Danish butter cookies… (Indian style food wasn’t much neither). Overall appearance of the lounge was rather filthy and not worth a visit.,Unknown,1.0,3,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,"Intolerable noise levels. Constant ringing of some bell for unclear reason, frequent overheads. Frantic atmosphere. No chance of getting a shower.

Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,Just brutal. I had a 2 hour layover on my flight from YYC-JNB. I desperately needed a shower so went to this lounge which was miles from my gate. KLM staff were rude and refused to acknowledge my existence. I finally figured out the number system for the shower. Got 65 and they were on something under 30. The lounge was crowded and noisy. I bailed without my shower and didn't even bother with the aggravation on the return trip and made do with wet wipes in the public bathroom. Not what I expected from a Business Class lounge.,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,1.0,1,2,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,"This is the worst ""Business Class"" lounge I have been in by a country mile. In fact calling it a lounge is a joke. It's full to capacity some people going straight back out because there aren't enough seats and only 1 or 2 charging points to fight over the décor is tired and dated. The toilets are absolutely disgusting I walked in then straight out to find some others in the Airport. No wonder they hide this facility down one of the gates and barely signpost it it really is that embarrassing. Most lounges offer easy access Wifi if you fight your way through all the mobile registration palava you're rewarded with a temperamental and incredibly slow service presumably due to the volume of users. Come on KLM you have to do better than this.",Shanghai Pudong Airport,2.0,1,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,no

Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,"Had high expectations as my family provided solid praise from their visit a few years ago. Was not disappointed. It's not a ""huge"" place but enough room for all on a Saturday afternoon dealing with a variety of flights. The self-serve drinks were varied and adequate the food skewed a bit to Asian spicy (for China Airlines pax?) and the seating comfortable and varied. A nice view of the apron & planes to boot. The only downside was the staffer on desk duty who was quite perplexed on how to deal with our Diner's Club cards had to ask in the back and in the end (as per my statement) I was charged for 3 guests instead of 3 free card admissions. (now under dispute for a refund). Ironically we were flying KLM and ran into a rather rude KLM staffer who was flogging $35 passes to all & sundry in the check-in area. Said our DC cards would not get us in. (yes they do that lounge desk girl not withstanding). That being said the guest rate for Diner's is only usd$28 or about cad$30. For about the same you can get into the Plaza Premium lounge right across the hall from Crown. However I do recommend it just try to maximize your time there.",Toronto Pearson Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,We needed to wait for close to four hours as the shopping centre next to the airport turned out to be closed. At Athens international airport KLM uses the Goldair lounge. The lounge offers comfortable chairs and provides good views of the runway but also the car rental centre. Wifi is provided for free but didn't work that well. There are desktop computers available as well as power sockets to charge your devices. What was disappointing was the lack of a shower / changing room (although the toilets were spacious) and the assortment of food was questionable. All in all not a bad experience but nothing like the KLM / Air France operated lounges. We saw that Lufthansa does operate their own lounge at Athens by the way.,Athens Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,yes
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,The KLM/AF lounge is located adjacent to the international boarding gates in terminal D. It can be accessed from the other terminals as well via the inter-terminal train without having to go through security. The lounge is relative small but I have not seen it overcrowded in the two times I visited. The seating is comfortable with the same types of chairs as the KLM lounges in AMS. In the middle of the lounge is the food and beverage area. The food is better than the AMS lounges with sandwiches salads soup cookies and other snacks as well as soft drinks and liquor. The booze selection is better than you will find in domestic carrier lounges. It is all free and self serve. You make everything the way you like it and no bartender to tip. There are two TVs located t either end of the lounge. The staff will accommodate your channel requests. There are boarding announcements and the gates are 60 seconds or less away. So you can remain in the sanctuary of the lounge until just before stepping on the plane. It would be nice if they added a shower. The restrooms are clean and adequate in number.,Houston Hobby Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,Would recommend this lounge came with all the fixings loads of snacks (great variety too) and drinks. Lounge access was only $35 and well worth it great option instead of paying for airport dinner.,Toronto Pearson Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,Nice surroundings comfortable chairs good connections good food and drinks (but limited choice). Can be crowded at times because so many partner airlines may use it as well. Well kept toilet area and shower facilities. A good start towards a long flight.,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,If you're flying out of Dammam this is the only lounge in town and it's marginally better than hanging out in the gate area at a coffee shop or the soon to be completed Cinnabon. Service in the lounge is almost non-existent and food selection is hit or miss -- sometimes there was dismal food but no plates to put it on other times there were marginally edible hot dishes (for example: rice a kind of chicken stew some really boring sauteed vegetables). There were not-very-tempting pastries in plastic wrap; maybe they were better than they looked but I didn't give them a try. There's no alcohol because you're in Saudi Arabia; you can get coffee tea soft drinks and faux juice drinks. I couldn't get WiFi and couldn't find anyplace where I could comfortably use a laptop anyway.,Dammam Port Airport,2.0,2,2,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,We had a long layover at Muscat so decided to crash at Oman Air Business Lounge. Great clean full facilities and food. Have great separate area for sleeping.

Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,Lounge is open since may 2013 located on the first floor. The lounge is small and has a variety of drinks alcoholic and non alcoholic and breads/croissants.

Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,One of the worst lounges they fill it up until there is no space left food is too basic no shower facilities as part of the entry you have to pay extra. And the service is quite bad.,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,1.0,1,2,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,The worst lounge? Like Air France Business Class Lounge in Paris CDG KLM clearly take the view that business class passengers are just a nuisance. The lounge is just row upon row of tired seating. The food is awful and wine undrinkable. Sad to say having just achieved gold status on Flying Blue (by accident!) I will probably have to use it again but I will want to eat elsewhere. And the staff have zero interest in passengers. Finally the washroom was filthy and smelt really bad. The one redeeming feature the WiFi copes will despite the constant overcrowding.,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,Not my first time in this lounge and it has nicely improved for those who remember the previous lounge. Food quality receives an average score. Drinks as much as you want. Cleaning and cooking staff should work faster as many plates of food remained empty too long and many empty plates and glasses remained too long where nobody was sitting. Staff are polite and helpful. Showers and lavatories are clean and comfortable showers can be very busy at peak hours. Seats are comfortable and give you a nice view of airport. If there would be some more tvs and some reading material such as international news papers this lounge would receive a better note.,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,Tiny lounge for KLM and Air France. In the evening when both flights to Amsterdam and Paris leave within 10mins of each other people were standing around. Very warm poor selection of food. One drinks machine and slow internet. I left soon after and went to main terminal to get more space and air.,Sao Paulo Guarulhos Airport,3.0,2,4,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,The lounge is nice with ample room. The choices of bevarages and food/snacks are OK. Cleanliness is somewhat debatable as the gents toilets were dirty and with an unpleasant smell. But the policy of internet access was really annoying - you get 30 mins free acess - and that's it. When I asked for another acess card I was rather impolitely told that there were only one per customer! Arguably you could use your mobile with tethering but that's also expensive. A better plan for wifi access would be a nice touch.,Madrid Barajas Airport,3.0,4,3,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,yes
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,I have used this lounge for KLM flights to and fro from Kuala Lumpur to Chicago. The lounge is big and spreads out. You can find a comfortable spot. There is a quiet room for those who prefer a nap. The food is not that great so best to have meals outside the lounge.,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,yes
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,Best thing to say about KLM lounges in Scriphol is that they are big. Most other services are mediocre. Biggest of all concerns is the attitude with most of the staff servicing customers : they are constantly sipping coffee and tea which they serve themselves from the same place as customers. When it comes to service they are usually short rude and inconsistent (between staff and the two lounges in the airport). I have been coming in the KLM lounges for well over five years and this is a repeated observation.,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,Visited the KLM Crown Lounge en route between Manchester and Taipei. First visit was 6pm in the evening and the lounge was quiet with plenty of choice of seats excellent choice of food and drink and fast wifi. On the way back we arrived at 7am and the lounge was far busier but the choice of food for breakfast items was still very comprehensive although the Wifi seemed a bit slower. I took advantage of the complimentary shower facilities but had to wait over an hour for my slot as it was so busy but as we had a long lay over it was no issue for me.,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes

Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,This terminal was under construction while I was there. Its located up stairs and you have to go out of the secure area. Roomy lounge and not crowded with nice view comfortable seating cold/warm food and lots of drinks of all kinds. 30 min before the boarding time a KLM rep came to escort all passengers to the security point and made it to the gate few min just before boarding and all went very well.,New York JFK Airport,3.0,4,3,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,yes
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,I arrived for a mid-morning flight and huge lounge was packed out. The food and drink area was in a circular design to handle the hordes but food was not of particularly good quality and the lounge didn't have a feeling of exclusivity. Much more food on offer out in the terminal itself. Only good point was free wifi and a free drink.,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,3.0,3,3,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,Not impressed with this lounge. At breakfast it was packed to the brim with passengers and the food on offer was very limited. Old computers tired furniture and a hectic atmosphere made me think it would be better to just go outside to one of the many concessions. No elite feeling whatsoever.,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,3.0,2,3,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,This was my first experience with my Priority Pass and I have to say I was very disappointed. Although this is a very small Airport the lounge was no more than a few couches and a magazine or two no Internet Access was available and the snacks were crackers or cookies in a package along with soda and water. This was all you received for $27 per person! I let Priority Pass know as soon as I arrived home and their response was sorry. In reading some other reviews it seems there are no standard levels of service with the lounges although they all charge the same price for access. I am sure there are some very nice lounges to offset the ones like I experienced perhaps a rating system would help prevent someone from experiencing what I did.,Unknown,2.0,1,2,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,KLM Crown Lounge is very large. You might find yourself walking quite a distance to reach depending on which gate you are departing from. The front desk staff are friendly and the wifi log in details are displayed at the desk. The seats are comfortable and have plug outlets. The food is actually pretty good. During lunch/dinner time you can get fried rice with chicken curry. For breakfast they serve a lot of pastries and other stuff. They have a large restroom inside the lounge as well as a business center where you can use the complimentary computers.,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,This is the lounge KLM inflicts upon it's business class passengers (not operated by KLM). It's small with dated decor. There is only one toilet cubicle for each sex. Food looked very ordinary. No wine. So bad I left and went to the bar opposite - so I could at least still use the free wifi. Please KLM - do a deal with Malaysian Airlines for your passengers to use their lounge. They're your codeshare partner in this part of the world!,Unknown,3.0,3,3,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,KLM/Air France Business Class Lounge in Johannesburg was dirty uncomfortable and shabby. I had the impression that it is the old Virgin Atlantic Lounge KLM/Air France took over the old lounge and that was it. They might think it is not necessary to renovate the place but at the moment it is not the standard of KLM/Air France. During my stay my table was never cleared of glasses or plates. There was nobody to clean the place or to take care of anything.,Johannesburg Airport,2.0,2,2,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,KLM crown lounge in AMS is far below its sister lounge in CDG. Little food to eat it was lunch time and poor quality of drinks. My seven year old son was charged 45e to be able to get inside the lounge whereas he got in for free at Paris. So I paid 45e so that he could drink a glass of water and have some crackers. KLM staff is rough in the air and on the ground.,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,2.0,3,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,Lounge huge with a nice assortment of snacks and drinks and there was a nice beef bourgignon on offer. Plenty of newspapers free WiFi but not the best speed. Staff friendly.,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,Crown lounge near gates B. Very clean and adequate shower cubicles. Had a few drinks and nibbles from the bar broad choice of newspapers. Very good lounge stylish with plenty of corners and areas to suit mood or privacy.,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,"A large open plan lounge which feels light and airy but very functional. Seats are comfortable with light and power at the vast majority. The selection of food was limited to nibbles/snacks - snack biscuits cheese cubes cheery tomatoes and soup. Not a great deal else - no sandwiches. Wine selection was good Heineken beer on tap and a range of standard quality spirits were on offer. Wifi was free however required you to reconfigure your mailbox if you wished to send emails. An enclosed entertainment area playing news channels made up the centre piece of the lounge washrooms were clean and tidy. The downside of the lounge was that there seemed to be a lack of staff clearing away such a large area resulting in a number of tables having ""leftovers"" on them for a considerable periods of time.",Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,3.0,4,3,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,The lounge is not that bad once you get past the very inconsistent service agents. This time I was refused lounge access as although being a Platinum for life I had a boarding pass for Turkish Airlines!,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,3.0,3,3,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,Used both Schengen and 52 lounge - great improvement over last time I used them - they have been refurbished. Free WiFi was very welcome. Good selection of self service drinks - snacks very limited. A good place to spend an hour of so waiting for your next flight.,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,Crowded lounge with good drinks selection and meagre snacks. Overall plastic and cheap-feel to it compared to AF or EK lounges in Dubai. Still a welcome haven from the crowded Dubai airport main lounges.,Dubai Airport,4.0,3,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,This lounge is shared by several airlines and was a pretty poor show. The lounge was really congested and there were not enough seats for all the passengers. Our flight was delayed so we spent even longer in there than planned. The front desk staff were pleasant but they chatted to one another non stop about another member of staff. As I was seated beside them I could not help but overhear. Not very professional!,Aberdeen Airport,2.0,3,3,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,no
Klm Royal Dutch Airlines,A very underwhelming business class lounge. food selection and quality is mediocre it is always busy and the toilets and shower rooms are boiling hot. What use is it to take a shower only to sweat through a shirt before you leave the shower room? At first I thought it was just me because I overheat easily but watching other passengers leave the shower area they were all red faced and sweating. Then there's the obvious issues with cleanliness the showers I've used have all had mould there is no shower curtain so the water splashes out onto your luggage and all over the floor. Add to that no wash cloths one towel and no floor mat and it is an entirely unpleasant experience. I've given them a few opportunities but from here on out I'm just going to go without a shower; remaining dirty is preferable to using these facilities. Then there's the staff on every occasion I've been to this lounge some KLM employees are courteous but most are dismissive rude and not the least bit interested in customer satisfaction. KLM service has been falling steadily over the years and it is apparent that things are near a breaking point as obvious budget cuts and lack of planning/staff training for non-aircraft positions doesn't rank more than a single star. On a plus side there is wi-fi I am using to write this!,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,2.0,2,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
Lufthansa,"A warm welcome from Lufthansa Lounge Staff. Lounge is split into two sections, one larger for business and one smaller for first. It is one of my preferred lounges as it has a direct connect thru a door to the jet bridge of the plane. Food and wine is excellent for a lounge, where the seating area for first can improve. As first class passenger, you can order wine and food from a menu and get it served on your table. For business class there is a food and bar with different kind of warm and cold food available. I got my food served right on the boarding call and the ground staff gave me another 15 min to finish as we were good on time.  Overall great service.",Washington Dulles Airport,10.0,3,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes

Lufthansa,"This lounge is quite large, and at 10am the seating was adequate and varied with leather chairs, work stations, and eating counters. The food and beverage selections were ample and tasty. The most important aspect however was the Lufthansa staff. There was a major problem with my reservation and ticket that didn't become apparent until after check-in, security, and passport control. When I went on-line to see if the adjacent seat was still open, I discovered that my assigned seat showed as unoccupied. The Lufthansa staff in the lounge spent 30 minutes calling back and forth to various United Airlines agents to resolve the problem. I will be eternally grateful to this staff and to Lufthansa in general. If I we're mean and petty, I would complain that this lounge is located in an interior space and offers no view of tarmac or runway. Nevertheless, if the situation boils down to viewing airplanes or getting to board a plane on which you thought you had a confirmed seat, I will go with the latter. Kudos and a thousand thanks to Lufthansa.",Munich Airport,10.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Lufthansa,I cannot understand why Lufthansa use this lounge - shared by a lot of companies it is a very umpleasant place. Not very clean with an extremely poor choice of drinks and food. The soft drinks in the fridge were not chilled. Staff unfriendly and slow service.,Lisbon Airport,2.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,yes
Lufthansa,"Visited on 1st June 2015 before UA 918 to LHR. Even though this lounge was overcrowded ( at 15:30 )and required a considerable odyssey from the UA gates, it was still worth the trek. They have champagne, free cocktails, and a more-than-adequate supply of good things to eat. There are big windows that overlook the tarmac, and you certainly get a good view of an Austrian Airlines 767. In sum, German efficiency, fine hospitality, and easily the best lounge at IAD If you're Star Gold, take the hike.",Washington Dulles Airport,6.0,2,3,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,yes

Lufthansa,Another visit to this lounge and nothing has been done to improve the miserably inadequate levels of catering. Soup or spaetzle potato salad and that's about it apart from a few pieces of bread and some peppers plus sweets and peanuts. So I've made yet another complaint and will keep doing so until something is done to improve matters.,Cologne/bonn Airport,2.0,4,4,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no
Lufthansa,The standard of catering in this lounge continues to deteriorate. Today the only choices were broth or soup - and a couple of trays of stewed vegetables. Plus the usual potato salad bread etc - but no meat of any kind. This lounge was once quite good but is now very mediocre. Also WiFi is often stretched to the limit. The two receptionists seemed totally bored and lacked much in the way of customer service skills. Come on Lufthansa - give this place a much-needed make over!,Cologne/bonn Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,no

Lufthansa,The lounge is hopelessly overcrowded the wifi doesn't function the food quality & display leave a lot to be desired. The cleanliness of the food preparation counters are unappetizing.

Certainly better lounge than a lot.,Frankfurt Main Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Lufthansa,The most complicated WiFi-access ever. The Lufthansa/Star Alliance lounge at the Delhi International Airport is fine except for the strange WiFi-routines. The lounge is big nice furniture good access to electricity nice staff clean good food and beverage selection clean restrooms but the WiFi! You receive an access code per device. You have to enter these codes and then wait for an SMS with some kind of verification code. When you return to the webpage after receiving the SMS-sent code then you are back to the initial page again and have to start all over again. If you are lucky you are logged in. If you are inactive on the internet for a few minutes you are logged out and have to ask for a new code and start all over again. Why make it so complicated. It is like the domestic Lufthansa lounges in the early 2000s.,Delhi Airport,3.0,4,5,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,yes
Lufthansa,The new lounge which was opened at the same time as new Z Concourse is very modern. However I noticed that the food selection and quality is getting lower each month. The sweets are just regular cookies but in the past there were chocolate pastries! The LH staff at the counter inside is far more occupied by phone or chit-chatting with each other than taking care of the passengers. I also noticed they grab drinks and snacks from the main bar and would enjoy them at their work position. No more refreshing towels on display to take. Now you have to ask for them at the counter and you get no more than 2!,Frankfurt Main Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,yes
Lufthansa,"Pleasant and spacious lounge with an acceptably tasty selection of warm/cold food snacks and beverages. Entrance staffing is odd. Non-LH entrance check leaves the two LH lounge dragons free to communicate nonstop. Which they do. Not by way of greeting guests more like ""nonstop them"". Weird choices of hot food: Both dishes were made of pork on both visits highly Muslim-friendly. The longest mobile-phone conversation clearly audible was when a Sky Chefs employee answered her phone to discuss her Sunday lunch. At least it sounded more interesting than what Sky Chefs offered in the lounge. Empty trays used to be refilled at faster speeds so your selection may be drastically reduced during a short visit. Empty dishes are removed from tables at infrequent intervals. Sky Chefs and LH offer a consistent experience: They present themselves as self-serving organisations which will accommodate customers albeit grudgingly and only once done with themselves.",Unknown,3.0,4,3,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,no
Lufthansa,Very decent size with a good range of food and drink available including weissbier on tap which is always welcome and traditional Bavarian specialties; welcoming area and a good amount of seating. Excellent selection of newspapers and a nice place to spend some time before the flight. No announcements; you need to check the screens yourself. Worth visiting again.,Munich Airport,5.0,5,4,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes

Lufthansa,First time in this lounge used AA Admirals Club and TAM First Class lounges previously while traveling on Lufthansa. This lounge is a downgrade. Very small and claustrophobic with no views and no windows. A small buffet of sub-standard appetizers including small salads and sweets which did not look appetizing. A poor bar selection couldn't find anything I wanted to drink. Had to seat and wait but temperature in the room was really high and I decided to leave and wait close to the gate instead. Hope Lufthansa will find a better options for their First and Business class customers as this does not match their high standards.,Sao Paulo Guarulhos Airport,3.0,2,4,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no
Lufthansa,Munich First Class lounge is still one of Lufthansa's best. Very well appointed elegant and classy with great service. In the restaurant plenty of good choices both on buffet and a la carte menu. Extensive wines and spirit list. Large magazines and newspapers selection. In the spa I noticed a drop in the level of service they no longer provided bath salts and other toiletries but one generic shower gel to be used as bubble bath shampoo soap and everything else. Even the now famous Lufthansa rubber duck was not available at first and had to be requested. Wifi was not working and receptionist suggested me to use the general Munich Flufghafen wifi which was ok. Later on board their wifi was out too. At the time of boarding had to walk for more than 10 minutes to the gate while in Frankfurt they automatically offer to take you to plane by a limo. They need to maintain the same standard as in their Frankfurt lounges.,Munich Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,yes
Lufthansa,A very nice lounge great cocktail bar. Food was also good and a fair choice. Staff friendly. Close to the smoking room. Good size with lots of areas to relax in.,Munich Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Lufthansa,Staff is excellent very attentive and friendly. Kids enjoyed the special kids play area. We spent some time in the shower section. Identical with all FCL of LH but here just only one has jacuzzi. Enzo toiletries and have time to relax and refresh. Breakfast choice was ok but quality of some items (croissant pastries) could be better for this level of lounge. Drink choice was really huge and fine. Food that starts at 10.30 is outstanding. Several dishes on buffet but the real top is the a la carte restaurant. Finally via private car (a Merc mini van as we were 4 ) to the aircraft. In total really 5 star experience.,Frankfurt Main Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Lufthansa,The lounge was busy and quite small and it is as with Terminal 1 ageing. There was still a very poor choice of food and beverages- only a poor quality English breakfast cereals and various hot and cold drinks were available. The lounge was quite comfortable with clean washrooms and good Wifi that worked well but the tables were quite dirty making for an average experience.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,3,3,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,no
Lufthansa,This is nice new lounge with ok food offerings good selection of beverages and newspapers/magazines. The free WIFI is not fast but works ok for e-mails. The main issue is that it is too small or that too many are allowed into it. In any case it is very difficult to find a place here the toilets are also overcrowded. For some reason they also decided to put just one person in front of the lounge to check your boarding pass so this takes a while especially with people using this employee as an information point. All-in-all good if you manage to find a spot. A definite improvement to the old lounges however.,Unknown,3.0,3,3,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,yes
Lufthansa,Newly opened lounge features impressive seating place with a brilliant view of an apron. There is free wi-fi inside with a very high operating speed.

Lufthansa,Lufthansa (LH) runs this Lounge as part of the SAS business lounge. The location is not that bad as the backdoor brings you directly to the gate and the staff calls for your flight. It's rather small with about 25 seats. Free Magazines and Papers WiFi 4 computers. Beverages are to LH standards food however is below standard. Waiting here for about 90min no problem 5 hrs would be a nightmare.,Newark Airport,4.0,3,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Lufthansa,Spacious lounge just beyond security in terminal A. Leather armchairs plenty of power points and some nice food although the range is a bit limited. Pleasant place to wait for a flight especially as there's not much at all in the airport itself!,Hannover Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Lufthansa,Arrived with Austrian Airlines at T1 and had a connecting flight to Sao Paulo with Lufthansa. I had to leave the main terminal and after a 6-8 minutes outside walk entered the First Class Terminal. Receptionist helped me with passport and security control and showed me the facilities which are exclusive for long haul First class passengers. The terminal has its own duty free and lounge with different seating areas huge bar restaurant and buffet area cigar room bathrooms etc. It is big and very elegant with many leather chairs and sofas and smaller rooms. It has large windows but no apron or runaways views. Huge bathroom complete with plushy towels and bathrobe and ETRO toiletries. Jacuzzi had none of the special spa features of the similar one at their Munich lounge. Small Duty Free had the main brands. Extensive menu for dinner buffet and a-la-carte restaurant but chose to have dinner on the flight instead. Great selection of magazines but wanted to use a computer and was told they no longer offer computers in the lounge which was a disappointment. 30 minutes before departure escorted downstairs where my passport was checked and Porsche Cayenne to the aircraft. This is a huge terminal which never got crowded very comfortable luxurious and well-appointed. It lacks some of the details of their smaller lounge in Munich.,Frankfurt Main Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Lufthansa,This lounge doubles as an arrivals and departures lounge so after a flight from Sao Paulo I decided to use the lounge. Nice reception with welcoming staff handed my passport to an official so passport control done in the lounge area which was and nice. Beautiful lounge not a huge one but cozy with different seating areas to choose with leather sofas and cocktail tables (with Mozart chocolates). 4 or 5 computer stations. Decided to take a bath more than half-a dozen bathrooms. Large marbled room with a jacuzzi rain shower area with bathrobe towels slippers and ETRO amenities. Staff came back with the Lufthansa First Class Lounge Rubber Duck! In the restaurant area I was handed a menu with brunch choices cooked according to taste but decided to check the buffet instead. Several choices of breads cheeses meats smoked fishes 2 or 3 hot entrees sweets etc. Unfortunately the lounge is inside the terminal and offers no apron or runway view but it does provide friendly and efficient service.,Munich Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Lufthansa,This is a delightful lounge. The staff knew who we were as I had asked for a massage to be pre- arranged. Check in was efficient. The first visit was on the outward flight to Cape town - so a long bath and rest before dining as we had plenty of time. The service was very friendly. On the return journey we arrived at 0500 and had 3 hours in the lounge. This time it was more crowded but the service again was impeccable - had a shower and a lovely breakfast. The best bit was the fact the plane was not on a stand so we were taken to the plane by a Merc.,Munich Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes

Lufthansa,Travelling with Lufthansa between MIA-FRA. The worst lounge I have ever visited. No service. Food - I would not even call that refreshments awful quality. Drinks only from the bar from a bartender - nothing special. Wi-Fi really slow practically impossible to use. Very crowded. No newspapers. Not worth it. No other options on Concourse J. Very poor facility comparing to regular Lufthansa or other Star Alliance lounges.,Miami Airport,2.0,2,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,no
Lufthansa,The lounge in the B concourse area looks very similar to the First Class Terminal but they are worlds apart. This morning there were two men and a woman to greet guests as they arrived. The two men were completely disinterested in greeting or lending a hand to adjust our seats on the next flight. It was like pulling teeth to have them assign us two seats together even though we already knew the flight was nearly half empty. They really don't belong especially after having just stepped off a terrific flight where every staff member did their absolute best to ensure a restful and pleasant journey for each passenger. The lounge is quite full almost every seat is taken. The food offerings look decent but perhaps a tad tired as it's nearly time to switch out for the lunch menu.,Frankfurt Main Airport,4.0,4,3,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,yes
Lufthansa,They offer only a small snack. I have been in the Lufthansa lounge B48 on my last flight. That lounge offers much more food and facilities. I was very angry what they offer the passenger at this C16 lounge.,Frankfurt Main Airport,3.0,2,4,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no

Lufthansa,I am not sure why I still go to this lounge as it has always been overcrowded not particularly clean with poor food offerings. This time the airport public areas outside were more peaceful than this place.

Lufthansa,This Senator lounge in Munich is one of my favourite. Cosy friendly staff amazing food high quality of wine and champagne and nice atmosphere. This lounge is only for Senator customers and Star Alliance Gold card holders.,Munich Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Lufthansa,Totally disappointing! Lufthansa advertises its Lounges as something exclusive. But the Lufthansa Business Lounge is such a shame. Food offer is bread rolls jam butter yoghurt a banana and pickled cucumbers. In Berlin at least it was empty but Munich was crowded in a way you don't even find a seat. Having in mind that in order to get into these lounges you were first paying Thousands of euro to Lufthansa flight tickets I am seriously surprised.,Munich Airport,3.0,2,4,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,no
Lufthansa,Very large lounge it seemed crowded at first but as we walked in a clockwise circle the crowd thinned. A huge variety of snacks and treats to enjoy. A few English newspapers no magazines except Golf. The bathrooms were cramped and awkward to use but clean. The wifi was free. It was a nice place to hang out for 2 hrs between flights.,Frankfurt Main Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Lufthansa,They know you and where you travel to when you enter the lounge immigration happens there and personally. The lounge is modern but with a warm atmosphere. You can help yourself at the buffet drinks are served to your seat or you can order a hot meal cooked freshly. The selection of food and drinks is great. Huge showers and you can have a bath if you like. Best of all you'll be taken to the plane by limousine if it's parked on an outside position and not docked to a gate.,Munich Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Lufthansa,What a wonderful enclave of service tucked into DTW's new North terminal. Excellent food/champagne. Attentive staff. Quiet/refined service. Beats any other business lounge in the USA. Limited hours but when open cannot be topped!,Detroit Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Lufthansa,Lounge is small but nice the only option for Star travellers in Mumbai. Staff welcoming and smiley. Food limited but more than just snacks. Could do with computer terminals in case you don't have a wifi device with you. Two let downs are it not having a flight screen at all in the lounge. Also they had a row of clocks for world time and had taken the Mumbai one down - I couldn't work out why if that one broke they didn't put the Singapore clock in its place and change its time.,Mumbai Airport,4.0,4,5,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Lufthansa,An older and smaller lounge of other Lufthansa lounges at Frankfurt. It is packed at all times and even if service is constant (bar and food) it is impossible to relax and have a seat. The venue is not at all in accordance with today's traveller. Staff should avoid having drinks and snacks from the passenger area and consumed at the front desk.,Frankfurt Main Airport,4.0,2,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Lufthansa,The Star Alliance lounge at CDG in terminal 2 near gates 60-6 is downstairs. The space proved to be comfortable and quiet with a very good selection of snacks drinks and sandwiches.,Paris CDG Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,yes
Lufthansa,It was a not up to par with Emirates/Qatar lounges it is very hard to find. The personal assistants are not all equal ours was not very good. You can not get a VAT refund for merchandise purchased that is considered carry-on. Beware of this fact. Breakfast area seemed busy and employees falling behind in servicing passengers. Quiet areas (non- cellphone areas) are not enforced and there was always someone talking everywhere even near the quiet relaxing chairs with blankets. Limo service to your flight you better request or demand the car you want when you arrive. They put my wife and I in a Minivan with two strangers Business class HON members. I felt this Terminal relative to my experiences around the world with others such as Qatar SIA etc was very poor. There are many Business class lounges that are better than Lufthansa's First Class Terminal experience.,Frankfurt Main Airport,3.0,4,3,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no
Lufthansa,Good lounge with great views. Selection of simple sandwiches and variety of drinks including alcoholic beverages. This lounge can get really crowded though with people lining up in front of the elevators.,Frankfurt Main Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Lufthansa,"Small Lounge no bathrooms no showers no baggage storage. Every drink has to be ordered at the bar you have to wait for the staff to show up. After several minutes of waiting for the Barkeeper I finally ordered 2 Cokes for me and my friend. When she asked me if I'd want anything else I asked for 2 additional Cokes as we were very thirsty and didn't know if she was going to leave again. Her answer: ""you can have one and have to come back to get another one"". Avoid that uncomfortable place with rude staff!",Houston Hobby Airport,2.0,1,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
Lufthansa,I splurged on business class tickets to take my 92 yr old mother to Russia. A reason for going business class was to have a comfortable place to wait during layovers in Frankfurt. What a mistake! The business class lounges were so crowded people were waiting in line to get in. Inside there was a cattle car feeling with no place to sit and no fresh air. I was mortified that my mother was forced to sit out in the airport lobby after I had promised her the luxury of business class. Never again Lufthansa!,Frankfurt Main Airport,2.0,1,2,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,no
Lufthansa,Compared to some time ago the lounges have improved . Instead of haribo sweets and beer they now offer simple sandwiches hot food desserts variety of cold dishes as well as a good choice in alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Staff friendly and good storage space. I think the main problems however are that a lot of people can make use of the lounges and they are overcrowded. Also a limited budget for the food and beverage service is evident. The lounge offered seating free wifi a drink and a nibble and storage for luggage.,Frankfurt Main Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes
Lufthansa,Mediocrity is the word that comes to mind. In terms of food the quality is subpar - it is horrible if you are a vegetarian. Quality of drinks is also below average. The seats are not comfortable and there is an air of tightness and inability to move around effortlessly. To me two positives stood out - the shower was wonderful (some toiletries provided) and the storage area to lock your handbags so you don't have to take them around. This is not a nice lounge.,Munich Airport,2.0,2,3,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,no
Lufthansa,Stopped by the gate A26 Senator Lounge at around 8am on a layover to Graz Austria. Terribly overcrowded. I took one walk around found no seats available took note of the 20 people standing around waiting for a seat and immediately left. I'm sure the food and beverages were fine but if I can't sit down what's the point. So the only thing I can rate this lounge on is comfort which gets a very poor score.,Frankfurt Main Airport,3.4,1,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,no
Lufthansa,"Visited this Senator lounge located at Gate B43 arriving at around noon. After visiting the Senator lounge at Gate A26 a week previously I was expecting the worst (cramped no seats available should be used as a broom closet etc). When I entered the lounge I was pleasantly surprised. This lounge is huge and was filled only to about 20% capacity. Very spacious and clean you aren't cramped. Although the lounge did fill up while I was there seats were available. The breakfast food was fine and plentiful and beverage selection is what you'd expect in a lounge. The staff were pleasant; they greeted as you arrived and farewell as you left. There was a bartender on hand to mix drinks. I had excellent WiFi connectivity. I just wished that there was a fine lounge like this at the ""A"" departure gates so that I can relax at my layover when I'm entering Europe instead of just when I'm leaving it.",Frankfurt Main Airport,4.0,5,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no
Lufthansa,This is the main hub of Lufthansa surely the most frequently used Senator Lounge in their entire network and yet it's tiny totally cramped and has absolutely no imagination style or flare in their decor at all. It looks like a cafeteria in an office building in 1990s Germany. When i arrived there were no seats at all available and I was forced to stand around waiting for 5 mins before I could even sit down. And the food was just very German (Bavarian) meat dishes with a cold creamy potato salad being the only vegetarian option in the whole place. Only 1 tv screen in one corner with no sound and I cant believe in another corner is a LCD display only showing tv advertising!! Having just come from the fantastic modern beautifully designed Senator lounge at JFK this feels like an economy lounge for Easyjet.,Frankfurt Main Airport,3.0,3,2,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no
Lufthansa,Beautiful Lounge well designed modern and well catered by polite and efficient staff. Food quality was excellent. Probably one of the best lounges I've been in for ages.,New York JFK Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,no
Lufthansa,Our flight from JFK landed half an hour early and there were many of us waiting outside for a considerable amount of time before the staff begrudgingly opened the lounge. One wonders if they knew we were coming! Showers are gorgeous food is acceptable but lounge staff attitude appalling. Such a contrast to other airline arrival lounges where they cannot do enough to help.,Frankfurt Main Airport,3.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,"Malaysia Airlines use the Air France Salon Première lounge at Charles De Gaulle Airport, Terminal 1. The lounge itself is nothing special with very limited selection of food and drinks and no toilets (have to go outside), but coffee and croissants/pain au Chocolat for breakfast are pretty decent. What's more important is that when you are travelling on a MAS flight as oneworld Sapphire Card holder MAS tries to send you to the dreadful ICare lounge. I was there for one minute and felt like cattle in a market. Literally no seats available and an extremely small space to manoeuvre. But oneworld Sapphire can also enter La Première and that would give you at least a more humane experience.",Paris CDG Airport,5.0,3,3,2.0,2.0,3.1,3.0,3.0,no
Lufthansa,I have been so appalled by the dismal Lufthansa Business Class Lounge at the A-Gates in Frankfurt that I felt the need to write a review. First and foremost the room was so hopelessly overcrowded there was barely a single free seat! Food offering is not just bad it is simply non-existent (if you like me don't consider peanuts a muffin and a slice of bread as a food offering). The overcrowding coupled with the sadly decreasing levels of etiquette and many people talking loudly on cell phones leads to simply unbearable noise levels. Slow wireless internet is available and is free but I can't imagine that anyone could get any serious work done in this type of environment. Highly unpleasant a disgrace.,Frankfurt Main Airport,2.0,1,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,no
Lufthansa,Been to 2 different business class lounges Mumbai and Munich. To be honest there is nothing much to offer. The lounges are overcrowded and the food is nothing great. To add internet access at Munich is not free! Also no reclining seats so no comfort to the back or neck at transit airports like Munich.,Munich Airport,3.0,2,3,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no
Lufthansa,Incredible service very attentive friendly and professional! Overall a most pleasant experience and a huge difference to most other airport lounges.,Frankfurt Main Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,"Oh what a difference a few years makes. On visiting this lounge in 2012 I thought it was one of the best I had been through, not this time. Tired, lights not working, food selection nothing like it used to be. Limited selection of drinks. Messy and unclean. Rest rooms that were filthy, no hand dryer that worked, and no paper towels. Lots of staff doing very little - well doing nothing. Lots of seating and that is one of the few positives, other than decent wi-fi. I have been a champion for Malaysia Airlines for a number of years, and I can see there is a whole world of challenges for the new CEO. This time around I cannot recommend using the Malaysia Airlines Golden Lounge in the International Satellite Building. I've used the Priority ""paid"" lounge and that was 100 times better than the Golden Wing Lounge, which is sad to say.",KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,3.0,3,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,Thought this lounge was below par because there are no dedicated bathroom facilities. The guest relations person was very helpful but it is not all about that is it!,Perth Airport,2.0,3,3,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,What a shocker! Confusing and overall a general lack of customer service. From the disinterested staff on the reception desk to the very poor washroom facilities. Food choices limited and overall a disappointing experience!,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,2.0,2,2,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no
Lufthansa,"Awful place. Not recommended. Dirty. Complimentary wifi requires red club membership. Very basic snacks. Not even close to the very basic business class standards. Try to avoid. Too pitiful Lufthansa partners with the guys to offer their ""business"" lounge to its passengers.",Denver Airport,1.0,1,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,no
Lufthansa,I must confirm that the Lufthansa Business class lounges (visited 3 at Frankfurt and one in Johannesburg ) are the worst without any doubt of any airline. If you are hungry visit a restaurant at the airport as the best Lufthansa has to offer is a huge bread roll with two coin sized slices of polony/fake ham. Queued for a toilet. Waited 30 min for a shower.,Frankfurt Main Airport,2.0,2,3,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,no
Lufthansa,One word terrible. Munich lounge Friday evening over crowded shabby and a disgrace to an alleged 4 star airline. One to be avoided at all costs.,Munich Airport,2.0,1,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,I recently travelled with Malaysia Airlines to and from Paris and so had the misfortune of using the iCare (OneWorld) Business lounge in CDG terminal 1. What a dump! Very small with old worn out couches. No Television or newspapers disgusting food and coffee no departure information screen and staff who are friendly but unable to know how to mix a simple drink. There are also no showers or change rooms and the toilets are outside of the lounge and shared by all of the business lounges. Definitely one of the worst Oneworld lounges I have used anywhere. But it does match with the rest of CDG airport which is also poorly designed badly maintained and very user unfriendly.,Paris CDG Airport,2.0,1,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,"Very ordinary particularly if you like a glass of wine and internet that is better than dial up. The general feel is ok until you get down to detail. First the bar which is not self serve and even beer is neither on display or available for self selection. As for red wine "" we only have merlot"" of a very ordinary kind. There is a first class lounge apparently at the ""satellite"" wherever that is but you won't be told about it in the main terminal unless you ask even if you are eligible. There is a definite don't care attitude in this place and as others have commented the showers and toilets are usable but not great. The food is ok and you can get freshly cooked noodles but it is pretty tasteless. Nothing here to encourage me to use MH or KL as a preferred hub but I guess I am spoilt with my regular regional being SQ with its very superior Singapore hub.",KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,2.0,3,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,In most respects this lounge is adequate. The WiFi is outrageously bad. On 1st April I got 7 Kbps download. Impossible to download even one email. Two other nearby pax complained. I went to reception where the agent said she gets so many complaints management doesn't act and please fill out a complaint form. MH management - are you listening? Go down the street and buy a decent router. Subscribe to a decent broadband service. Stop mucking around and deliver - most of us in this lounge are on business and internet is vital.,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,3.0,4,5,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,no
Lufthansa,Terminal A : Had to go there since the only business lounge available was this. Very crowded couldn't find a single seat! I could swear that some were leaning on sofa chairs for rest till somebody leaves a spot. Not a single item of food was visible only draft beer. We had to leave since no seat was available and it was better to get some food outside. I wouldn't dream of coming here again. Terminal B a lot more spacious than the one in A. More food selection (bread vegetable noodle soup cream cheese/Butter olives and pickles) and soft drinks/beer is provided. A single 40inch-something monitor was only available. Good selection of newspapers (they had chinese/arabic newspapers as well I was surprised). An okay lounge but it would need more improvement on the food bar selection. Both lounges you have to pay for Wi-Fi.,Frankfurt Main Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,no
Lufthansa,Lounge was over crowded and there was no where for me to sit. Wifi was not free which is joke and of the computers that offered 'Free Wifi' I was unable to log into any of my email accounts - the internet just didn't work. Onboard I was promised 'free breakfast at the business class lounge' on arrival at the airport should I choose not to eat on the plane. Imagine my disappointment when all that was available was asparagus soup - that tasted like dish water. Coming off an overnight flight from the US and waiting to connect to another flight I expected better food to be waiting for me and at least a place to sit and be able to check my emails also.,Frankfurt Main Airport,2.0,1,3,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,no
Lufthansa,Spent half-an-hour in this lounge yesterday and I thought that it was very much in line with the typical Lufthansa offering. Even food and snacks feel standardized across the world when you travel Lufthansa! I liked the good location close to the gates and pleasant staff. I disliked the bulky and complicated way to get Internet Access and the computers in the lounge should have been sent to a museum about ten years ago!,Washington Dulles Airport,3.0,3,3,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,There have clearly been some attempts to upgrade this place since I was last there 3 years ago but without too much success  it has to be said. Another of those huge impersonal lounges that can get crowded. Without wishing to be snobbish this seems to be as a result of allowing access to non Biz/First class passengers who are on other airlines' FF lists or have just bought passes for cash. I suppose the rather bizarre almost 'speakeasy' hidden alcohol bar is a sop to the religious people in the country and the choice/quality is OK but no more. Also food is adequate without being impressive. Seating is reasonably comfortable but the toilets/showers are starting to show their age. To be quite honest the MAS Business class lounge in the domestic part of the terminal is a far nicer experience less impersonal better seating and food (including an absolutely fantastic malay chicken curry). OK they do not pretend to serve alcohol (as on their domestic flights) but at least you know where you stand.,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,3.0,3,3,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,A surprisingly poor offering from MAS. This lounge is large poorly arranged (seats in lines and very closely spaced) dirty poorly equipped and in dire need of renovation. There is a small bar near the entrance which serves a very limited selection of alcoholic drinks (no self service) including a couple of poor quality wines beer and no champagne or spirits. The bar also closes early regardless of the number of passengers in the lounge. Hot food was cold and there was a very limited selection. Hot drinks machines were poor but there was a serviced coffee bar with a good selection of coffees and teas made to order. WiFi so slow it was next to useless. Overall very poor - looking forward to the Emirates Lounge reopening after refurbishment.,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,1.0,1,1,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,There is a Golden Lounge located in both terminals. This I found out after being directed to the satellite terminal by airport staff when I could have stayed in the main terminal. I preferred the main terminal lounge. The food was of good quality with hot and cold options. I arrived just before the change over from breakfast to lunch. There is a bar but you are made to feel awkward as it's hidden away. The tables are not cleared very often however and there was only a cold shower available.,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,3.0,4,3,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
Lufthansa,"Overcrowded at first but it cleared out as I had four hours to wait on my flight. This is the only lounge I have seen within the Star Alliance group to charge for internet usage. That is just stupid. As always the staff are unpleasant and unhelpful. When I asked if I could get a wireless card with a password I was told and I quote: ""Yes. Your Credit Card."" very succinctly. I have to agree with most of the reviews I have seen so far - chairs are uncomfortable it can be very crowded and the two tiny elevators allowing access to the lounge are ridiculous and slow. All of the Star Alliance airlines need to get together and take a course from Singapore Airlines on how to run a proper lounge. Services are so inconsistent across all of the airlines that it's almost comedic.",Frankfurt Main Airport,2.0,2,3,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,no
Lufthansa,Overcrowded mess. The worst thing is that the only way to get in or out (barring a fire) is through two tiny and slow elevators. I was shocked when I was trying to go to my plane and I had to wait for a long line to clear just to get out. I'm sure people have missed their flights because of that set up.,Frankfurt Main Airport,2.0,3,2,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no
Lufthansa,"As I write I am sitting in this lounge. Of course I cannot use my own computer unless I pay 8 euros per hour : 9 booths are provided free so one waits for one of these to be unoccupied. The business class lounge is better than this one a better selection of food and drinks and some (not all) of the staff make an effort to please. Here for lunch there is a selection of nibbles and one dish. There are 6 wines on offer 2 of which are inferior ""Methode"" sparkling whites: the best is a medium grade red rioja. The showers are fine provided you use them late afternoon. If you wait until just before a late flight as is normal they are crowded. When I think of the facilities offered in Changi I have to ask myself why SIA want to be in this alliance.",Frankfurt Main Airport,2.0,3,3,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,Difficult when airlines use a generic airport lounge for a small number of business class passengers. The lounge is new but the food on offer wasn't appealing.,Denpasar Bali Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,UseHaving used this lounge for the past 6 years to travel from KL to Beijing the time has come to switch to Singapore Airlines although more costly and a longer flight. The toilets today (10 Mar 15) were disgusting and unusable and clearly hadn't been cleaned for a while and the service in their so called sports bar was beyond comprehension. Clearly the airline is going through difficult times but surely now if the the time to do whatever is possible to increase the customers experience. I complained to two people in the lounge who really couldn't care and never made any attempt to apologize or have the toilets cleaned so enough is enough.,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,2.0,3,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,UseMy flight was 3 hours ahead and I spent my quality time waiting in this lounge. The environment was quiet and cozy. The food was absolutely delicious especially the beef rendang! I kept on refilling my plates while waiting. There's even a massage corner. However the WiFi was just average. But nevertheless I would definitely come again here! A very welcoming lounge.,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,4.0,5,4,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,yes
Lufthansa,The lounge feels like a mess hall rather than a lounge. Wifi is not free the furniture is not comfortable and the place is overcrowded. As I type this I am sharing a small table with three other people who were scrambling for a seat.

Lufthansa,Was on route to DUB via MUC had the chance to sample the Lufthansa lounge in IST. The best thing about this place is knowing you will be leaving. Dark and dirty are the two words that best capture the feel of this place. No external windows carpets and soft furnishings were well past their sell by date. The snacks and beverages were very average. Find it hard to think that Lufthansa would be happy to use this lounge going forward. The positive was that there was free Wi Fi.,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,2.0,2,1,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,no
Lufthansa,The decor is a bit cold and not very welcoming. The selection of food limited though the Oktober Fest special was a nice touch. The selection of drinks is varied and good. I find it really strange that Lufthansa does not offer free WiFi in their Senator lounges (nor the business class lounges). But the lounge is a welcome escape from the not very customer friendly Tegel airport. The staff at the front desk not very welcoming though I have had very good experiences at other times.,Berlin Tegel Airport,3.0,3,5,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,Even though it was a small lounge it was very cosy. There are good views of the tarmac as well. The staff were very polite. The whole lounge was very clean including the toilets. Maybe if there was one small thing I would pick on is to have more varieties of food. Other than that the lounge is wonderful and I would recommend it.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes

Lufthansa,A bit disappointing. Stale bread watery fruit salad some nuts and a full freezer full of mini-ice creams - an odd mix of food! Wifi and computers were spotty but they did try to fix them immediately. Lounge was fairly comfortable if a bit drab and boring. Was starving but had to go outside to the airport where there were many good options to purchase food.,Dusseldorf Airport,3.0,3,4,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,no

Malaysia Airlines,Spacious good views of lanes outside. Sleeping massage and shower facilities. Lounge is kept in dull brown colours. Good food inc. 3 options of hot dishes from Malay kitchen.

Malaysia Airlines,We use this lounge twice a year on return flights to Europe. It does the job. However dispte some renovation recently it could do with better and more shower cubicles and also toilets. Quite often there is a wait for both. Food and drinks adequate. They do need to lift the lounge to bring it up to the standards expected. They operate a very good business class in their planes. They may have to spend some money to bring the lounge up to the standard of their aircraft.,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,4.0,3,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes
Malaysia Airlines,This lounge is an embarrassment. Staff is largely absent food is Lukewarm lounge is an open seating area in the mezzanine of Delhi International where the noise comes in unfiltered there are four old Win95 desktops WiFi requires a complex picture ID procedure and bathrooms are basically the same quality toilets you find anywhere in the airport (so forget freshening up). There is some premium Lounge next door but the difference in access to the two is unclear to me. At any rate lounges like this make me wonder whether I should fly this airline at all again. Hopefully their hub lounge in KL is better.,Delhi Airport,2.0,1,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,no
Lufthansa,Being quite spacious the lounge features several areas. A working area for laptop users a kind of bistro area and a spacious relaxation area with several TV screens. Two lavatories and two bars (with only one featuring the full variety of available snacks and drinks). Snacks include the usual cake and soup selections drinks include soft and hard beverages alongside two kinds of draught beer. Wireless internet is not available free of charge.,Dusseldorf Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,no
Lufthansa,The lounge was a joke! We flew a Star Alliance airline and was told that we could use Lufthansa business lounge. We had to walk very far from our gate go through a security check point to get to the lounge. Then later after we exited from the lounge we had to go through another security check point at our gate. That added up to a lot of time. We hope for a decent cup of coffee but it was terrible coming out of a coffee machine. A few cups of yogurt on a tray open to all sneezing customers. Sandwiches were made with old bread as hard as rock! No free internet connection! We will not go to this lounge again and will complain to our airline.,Frankfurt Main Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Lufthansa,The standard and variety of food and beverages available in this Gold Card-only lounge continue to deteriorate. The furniture isn't particularly comfortable working space is cramped and the whole ambience of the place is very run down and second rate. Presumably it's because Lufthansa spend all their resources pandering to the first class lounge users and do not see their Gold Card holders as meriting much in the way of service. It used to be a lot better; why have they allowed their standards to slip so low?,Frankfurt Main Airport,2.0,3,3,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,MAS continues to do what it does well - disappoint. How hard can it be to keep a place clean have staff who want to help food that is worth eating and provide alcohol without guests feeling like they should not drink alcohol. Seems all of this is impossible for MH. Perhaps one needs to have to have a different mindset to truly appreciate Malaysian Hospitality?,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,2.0,3,2,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,Used the lounge while waiting for flight to Auckland. Spacious yes - impressed no. At the front desk beyond asking for the boarding pass frontline staff seem to assume that everyone who came knew what the Golden Lounge had to offer. No attempt to explain its facilities. Upon entering you come upon the room where liquor is served but it was small and so far from everything else. Sofa seats were arranged in lines and close together. Buffet choices very limited. Everything was self service much like a canteen. Glasses so small probably to discourage one from taking too much thus necessitating frequent trips for refills. I stood there for 3 glasses of juice before I moved off with a 4th. That's how small the glasses were. Tables while cleared of glasses and plates were not wiped down. I saw just one staff clearing tables. I did not realise there was 2 other counters serving food. There was no signboard to the shower/washrooms. Inside the shower stalls were not clean bits of hair left behind and why is the floor in the shower area level with the changing area. Good thing my shoes were near the outer door or they would have been soaked. After what you read in the Malaysia Airlines web page this was a disappointment you've oversold yourself. Come on MAS you can do better than this.,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,2.0,3,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,yes

Lufthansa,Hon circle lounge at Frankfurt is very spacious and tastefully appointed lounge. Sit down restaurant area with excellent food options full bar with bar tender.

Malaysia Airlines,Was looking to experience this so called MH flagship lounge. But I only found great disappointments once I arrived there. The newly renovated lounge had a cheap mess hall or school canteen feel to it as the chairs and tables were plonked in lines and rows in a big open area (not to mention the bland high ceiling) to maximize the capacity. As a result no 'personal space' and very crowded as everybody was close to each other. Chairs not comfy. No sign to the toilets had to ask staff for it. The toilet was so basic and small. Food selection adequate but not extensive. It's understandable due to their religion practice they set up the bar way off the main dining area and very close to the main entrance and had a walk a fair bit to get a glass of drinks. Internet was fast and reliable. Overall I was not impressed with this 5-star lounge.,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,3.0,2,3,2.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,Upgrading lounge so 'temporary' lounge is in a grotty couple of rooms next to Starbucks. Check In staff didn't even mention that the real lounge was closed. Almost no airport staff knew where the lounge was and the only sign is a hand written a4 sheet taped to the door. Catering was awful alcohol none existent and staff very stand offish.,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,2.0,2,1,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,After a flight into KLIA from PER I was looking forward to using their flagship lounge to freshen up and relax before continuing onto LHR late that evening. What a let down. Trying to find a seat was the first obstacle my wife and I encountered and when we finally did trying to locate staff to clean the area was our next. Requesting use of the showers was met with a courteous and immediate response of yes. However when I entered through the doors it was like the area had not been serviced since the first flight of the day. No toilet tissue to be found unless you raided every cubicle prior. And the floors needed a hose down. Showers only saving grace was that the water pressure and temperature was very good as they were not very clean to begin with. With half an hour before boarding MH2 to LHR I decided to have a drink at the bar by the entrance to lounge. Selections are only average at best with no champagne only a French sparkling but that was no bother as I knew the best was to come on board. To wrap up the experience of what is meant to be their flagship lounge I have noticed its gradual decline since I first started using this service on numerous occasions since 2000. I will be returning from LHR mid Jan and look forward to experiencing the Golden Lounge of Terminal 4 as I have heard great reviews of this one. Will keep you all posted.,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,2.0,3,1,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,no
Lufthansa,"The intercom button is still a challenge to find at the ground level entrance. Food selection was very good; the alcohol choices were more than extensive. Staff with a few exceptions was very helpful. The cigar lounge (smoking area) for some unknown reason is much larger than the computer area. There were often people waiting to use the handful of computers but no one waiting to use the smoking lounge; at times the WiFi wasn't working adding to the computer delays. Because of the personal/financial security issues with wireless connections I would have expected the first class terminal to use wired connections in the computer cubicles with WiFi (with WPA2 for wireless security) in the rest of the building. Separate cubicles for people with their own laptops are needed so they do not tie up the very limited number of computer/desk cubicles. The fact that the computer cubicles are several steps higher than the main floor level is a design flaw being a hassle for passengers with mobility issues heavy luggage etc. Transport to the plane is a great feature in such a large airport although their policy of waiting until the last minute for this service depends on no slip ups and carries ""just in time"" behavior to far. My driver was about to get my luggage from the trunk of his car when I questioned the model of Airbus we had just parked under ( he had taken me to the wrong gate). If major European airports would use the same gate numbers inside the terminals as outside the terminals it would remove this needless complexity. As I wanted to avoid I had to rush to get settled at my seat before the plane started moving away from the gate.",Frankfurt Main Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,no
Lufthansa,This lounge is new in terminal 1C and looks like a canteen. No style at all. Drink choice average food almost non existing. Only nice touch is that it has a direct boarding gate for business passengers. Lounge staff just sit at the door checking if you are qualified to enter. No free wi-fi and this is what I don't understand. It is 2010 now and internet is a part of our and still you have to pay 8 euros for an hour. Lufthansa should be really reconsider the passengers need. The lounge is just gate with some bigger chairs a table with drinks and so called food.,Frankfurt Main Airport,2.0,1,3,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no
Lufthansa,The lounge was totally crowded with many people standing and not having a seat. Passengers with luggage were bumping into seated travellers while trying to find a space to sit down. Small tables and uncomfy seats. Mediocre food just some awesome sandwiches. As the Star Alliance grows someone would expect an adjusted lounge to cater for the increased number of business and first class traveller. Staff tried hard to clean tables but had a hard time to get glasses and plates back to the kitchen.,Dubai Airport,2.0,2,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,"The business class lounge upstairs in the satellite terminal (that I have visited earlier this year) was closed. The temporary lounge was difficult to find and small with no shower facilities and unwelcoming unhelpful staff. The lounge was cramped and there were no shower facilities and limited food options. So I asked the staff if there was another business class lounge was given confusing instructions by a disinterested & slightly rude staff member and told to go back on the train to the main terminal to the ""regional"" business class lounge (for international and domestic flights). The regional lounge was completely full. Nonetheless after a wait I was able to take a shower in the short time left before my flight. The washroom staff were disinterested and no towels were provided (I used paper towels to dry myself). After having spent my time locating the various lounges there was no time for food and I had to take the train back to the satellite terminal for my flig ht. Once at the gate there was no announcement for business class boarding so I ended up boarding with the rest of the flight.

Malaysia Airlines,I used the KLIA lounge in transit and was impressed. If in transit stay in the Satellite building and head upstairs when you reach the air train - it isn't incredibly well signposted. It is large with plenty of natural light via big windows it has lockers newspapers magazines and many seating areas. There was a business centre with helpful staff. Lounge PCs offer internet and printing. Excellent range of food included noodles and soups barista made coffees and full range of teas fresh fruit plus I saw a variety of other dishes. There are several food service areas - all have different offerings. There is a bar with limited choices but white wine they offered was fine. Bathrooms with amenity packs and had hot showers both times - they are at the far end of the lounge and staff will give you towels and packs with shampoo etc.,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Malaysia Airlines,On our way to Bali we used the KL first class lounge and it was great but on return 5th November it was closed - no reason given but everyone was herded into a small holding lounge to sit out the time.

Lufthansa,What a disappointment. This is a small dreary and window-less lounge packed full with passengers awaiting the Frankfurt and Munich departures (leave within minutes of each other). We couldn't find a seat despite arriving in the lounge almost two hours before departure. There are no showers which could have been a nice touch considering the flights to Germany leave at around 3am - an awkward time meaning that most passengers would have long ago checked out of their hotels and be in need of a freshening up particularly after a day of touring hot and humid Mumbai. At least wifi is free (unlike Lufthansa lounges in Frankfurt!).,Mumbai Airport,3.0,2,3,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
Lufthansa,Thai is the lounge used for passengers flying on star alliance carriers. Drink selection good but food was simply awful. The noodles were gobbled up so quickly that the staff couldnt keep the dish full! Internet ok and the lounge chairs have been replaced and at least look the part even if some are not particularly comfortable. Not up to the standard I have come to expect from TG lounges.,Unknown,4.0,3,4,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no
Lufthansa,Borderline rude staff with more than a slightly condescending attitude and manner. A definite feeling of everything was too much trouble. However once in the lounge the – mostly Asian – staff were relatively friendly and efficient but still lacking. The atmosphere in this very spacious lounge is pleasant and relaxing and knocks spots off any lounge in FRA with the exception of the F Class Terminal. I arrived at 4:40 pm. and only awful-smelling soup and the remains of crisps nuts and the like could be found. At 5 pm. hot snacks were brought out and were surprisingly tasty. Drinks selection is moderately good. Armchairs with low tables and Café-style tables and chairs are available and are kept quite clean. Toilet area clean. Internet access and WLAN.

Malaysia Airlines,Lounge had a soft lighting to it being better than the domestic lounge at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. It's not big but accommodated well for 2 to 3 flights. Food choices were poor and cheap though: they offered rice meat and vegetables that were simply foreign for the locals. No western cuisine. Seating area was a tad dense in arrangement. A lounge that fits it purpose and a better offering compared to the one at its hub in Kuala Lumpur.,Kuching Airport,3.0,4,5,4.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,yes
Malaysia Airlines,A long queue to enter the lounge which I simply by-passed rather than stand in line for 15 minutes. Inside the lounge was crowded. Seats are small and cheap looking. My search for a virgin mary was fruitless. No worcester sauce no tabasco no lemon juice etc. I tried a chicken stew which was cold. I left and paid for my own drinks in the main terminal rather than spend any time in the dreary uncomfortable surroundings.,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,2.0,2,3,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,no

Lufthansa,Lufthansa should be ashamed to offer such a dump to their and their star alliance partner business class passengers. Old and run-down furniture empty plates remained on tables for long time and filthy carpets gave me the impression I was sitting in a run-down train station. Only potato salad and some sort of meat dumplings on offer and standard drinks at the self service counter. Lounge (above my SQ flights departure gate B 48) offers nice views of the tarmac but the outdoor viewing area is closed and appears to be closed some time already due to the weeds growing outside. Why wasn't I surprised that no free wireless internet was available but you had to pay for WIFI. Do have to point out that the shower facilities were flawless and very clean and well maintained.

Lufthansa,The lounge is at the very far end of the finger with most intra-Schengen flights and it might well take up to 15 minutes to reach and then the same amount of time again to go to the connection gate.

There is free WiFi which was very fast I'm not sure how it compares when the lounge is busy. There was a good selection of soft drinks and juices but you have to hunt around for the alcohol (cans of Tiger/Heineken and a wine bottle hidden behind an opaque-doored section of one of the small fridges).

It is looking a bit faded and could do with an upgrade but the food is always adequate with respect to quality and variety staff clear the tables frequently and keep everything tidy and the toilets are always clean. Two complaints : It is usually impossible to get a hot shower the water being no better than warm no bath mat is provided and the showers are not wiped down after each use. On the plus side the towels provided are big and white and fluffy. A lot of the seats in the lounge don't have a power point close enough to plug in a laptop so a long wait for the next fight can use a lot of battery power.,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes

Lufthansa,Lufthansa has just recently opened its first arrivals lounge in Frankfurt airport. Its open for premium passengers as well as elite loyalty card holders arriving on long haul flights. Its open from 5am until 12.30 pm and is located just outside the exit of baggage in Terminal 1B. It was bright and staff took care of my luggage and stored it in a secure area. The reception asked me if I needed a shower and directed me to the shower area downstairs. When I went down another staff directed me to the shower room and it was nice to see a welcome note displaying my name on a LCD screen in the shower room! The shower was delightful and had heated granite floors rainforest shower heads Occitane toiletries etc. There was an extensive breakfast buffet with hot items like scrambled eggs pancakes waffles etc and fired eggs could be ordered too. Cup noodles available on request. A lot of cold items like cereals cold cuts cheese etc . Ample dining space free internet via computer terminal snooze areas were other features of lounge.

Excellent drink selection but food selection is a little bit chaotic. They have a lot of stuff which not really fits together and especially the salads are low-quality convenience products with tons of mayonaise. Only limited offer of cake sweets or chocolate. Extensive offer of national and international newspapers. Actually they had set up a smoothy bar where a bartender made fresh smoothies.

The dining tables and chairs were in the cold buffet section - the low coffee tables and armchairs were the seats for the hot food - who designed this nonsense? At 7am the lounge was not busy but dirty plates cups uneaten food covered the tables. Supervisors just walked past without comment - disgusting.

I looked around for a bar and finding nothing but a few oddments on a makeshift bar area asked a staff member for help. To my great surprise I was told there was no wine no gin and precious little of anything else! The staff member was curt and unhelpful to the point of being rude walking away while I asked the questions - after six weeks in a country of courteous people this discourtesy astounded me. My husband asked a senior staff member if we could have a glass of wine and was told that the airline was having difficulty getting alcohol through customs. A further problem was that the announcements in the lounge were virtually inaudible so keeping an eye on the departure board was essential.

At 11.00 am they had run our of clean glasses saying they were all broken. We had to wait for hot glasses from the dishwasher. There was no fruit just some indigestible pieces of foccacia type bread and defrosted rather tasteless sandwiches. Limited supply of juices. Where were the platters of lovely Italian meats and cheeses? The shower was broken. The coffee machine was broken. Only one bottle of wine in an ice bucket. it was a poorly run cafe with one overworked staff member in evidence rather than a business lounge for people who had paid a great deal of money.,Rome Fiumicino Airport,2.0,3,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,Quality of meals available the lounge seemed to have deteriorated since the last time I used in a few years ago. The hot meal selection was rather cheap. Beverage selection much better with good selection of drinks. Wireless access was slow. They should upgrade to a wider bandwidth. Reception staff were rather unprofessional.

Malaysia Airlines,Small lounge in CDG terminal 1 (run by Air France?) shared by several airlines. It was quiet and felt reasonably spacious with a selection of snacks and pastries but no hot food. Comfortable seating provided. There was also a reasonable selection of beverages (soft and alcoholic). The main negative is that the toliets are outside of the lounge.

Malaysia Airlines,An enormous lounge that provides plenty of comfortable seats with excellent views of the tarmac. There is a self-service bar for alcoholic beverages and soft drinks and a cafe for hot drinks where you can also order freshly prepared meals. The shower facilities were quite good too. Lounge staff were friendly and helpful. Free Wi-fi was provided and there were also a few computer stations with internet access for those who don't have laptops.,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,Spacious lounge with ample and comfortable seating. There was a reasonable selection of food and beverages. You also get a nice view of the tarmac. Free Wi-fi and computer stations available. Staff were friendly and welcoming.,Penang Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no

Food and drink well supplied and constantly replenished with good wait staff. Wi-Fi excellent and flight announcements clear,Sydney Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Malaysia Airlines,A very airy clean and spacious lounge located close to runways with excellent views. Lounge has very quiet atmosphere and is calming with plenty of seating. Excellent facilities with high standard of repair showers and rest rooms in immaculate order at time of our visit. Good choice of bakery and cold foods but hot food less appealing and with limited choice. Champagne and other drinks regularly offered by staff that provided great customer service. The best aspect of this lounge is when your flight is ready you are informed and personally escorted straight to the aircraft at Gate 6 a short lift ride away with no waiting or queuing whatsoever.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,MH uses this lounge for their Biz Class passengers. Medium size lounge with easy access and views over the terminal from the first floor. Lounge quiet with soft lighting and good seating. Plentiful supply of reading material and access to departure info via screens. Internet desks available. Good choice of hot and cold food with hot food being constantly replenished. Good choice of beverages and alcohol. Rest rooms and showers in good order and clean. Staff very helpful and cleared surfaces quickly. Flights called over tannoy with short walk to departure gates.,Brisbane Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,This is the worst business lounge I have ever been in. There was no fresh food on offer only pre packaged crackers and nuts. The only champagne on offer had a half glass of flat stale champagne in it and apart from that there was only one choice of beer and white wine for Air France you really would expect better. No internet service was offered when I asked I was told to log into my own Air France orange account. Not happy about that. The toilets looked like something out of a derelict Asian department store and accessed from outside the lounge very poor and unclean. The staff were not very welcoming and seemed more interested in getting passengers out of the lounge and to the gate rather than letting them relax. This experience will certainly affect future airline used to fly out of CDG Air France will never be a choice.,Paris CDG Airport,1.0,2,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,New Business Class Lounge at Heathrow T4 overlooks the Malaysia Gate (Gate 6) - good seating area with plenty of drinks on offer. Food was of 'Malaysian' origin OK but not plentiful. Free WiFi.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,As landed on international flight paid a visit to this lounge before regional connecting flight. Very pleasant lounge with good selection of food/drinks including champagne. Very quiet at time of visit (11am) and outnumbered by staff.,Unknown,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no

Malaysia Airlines,As the main hub of the airline we found this lounge to be very good and serving it's customers well. Maybe a little frayed around the edges. We had no trouble gaining admission 7 hrs before flight and stayed there the whole time. Good selection of food drinks and reading material. Loved the ice-cream. Even when busy still seemed calm and tranquil. The golf putting room is a great idea and I am sorry did not get to try this. Nice view of the runways.,Unknown,4.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,Very quiet and east to find. Small range of food but what was there was quite tasty. Good selection of reading material. Beautiful bathrooms. Enjoyed the self service bar. Sure it could be better but there was only 1 flight leaving.,Sydney Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,The regional lounge really nice. The food selection is quite good. Nice view where passenger can see the aircraft from a large window. Passenger also can order the food from the chef. The washroom really big and comfortable. They also have a small playground for kids.,Unknown,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,A huge negative is the selection of food or rather lack of. We traveled over a 5 week period & the only hot meal offered that was not a stir fry or curry was potato & leek soup. This did not change over the 5 weeks. The other food offered was average to say the least. At Kuala Lumpur Golden Lounge the only cheese to be eaten with the bountiful supply of crackers was cream cheese! Wraps bagels or small rolls & not much more.,Unknown,4.0,5,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,Very impressive you can tell its almost brand new when you step in. Great large chairs to relax in. Food choices good but they should not serve items like fried fish pieces in a food warmer and have it closed - these items tend to harden up and become a real challenge for your teeth! Drinks selection for alcoholic beverages had a bartender service which you had to use which I dont really appreciate - I would prefer a self service bar but only because I'm more used to it. Noodle bar was very nice. There was also a children's play room Surau Prayer room and a massage service corner- but you had to pay for every treatment or massage available - unlike Thai AIrways BKK massage lounge which gave business class passengers a free 30 min massage. Would have been good if MH offered that. The bathrooms were nice but toilet amenities were not 5 star standard. Previously MH provided L'Occitane and Aigner toiletries but this is no longer the case. In all a great lounge - much much better than the Business class lounge at the satellite building less people which means your chances of getting to use the shower is quite high and also more peace of mind! Only 1 criticism - too many staff on duty - wherever you walk they follow you like as though they're keeping a look out just in case you get up to no good! I know they are only there to see if you need any service but don't overdo it. Some travellers just want some peace and space.,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Malaysia Airlines,Lounge is superb! It's far more spacious and impressive than the 1st/ Biz class lounges at the Satellite Building. Great warm and cold food selection good varieties at noodle bar delightful bar selection comfy business centre good natural lighting and viewing area internet stations and fully wifi lounge massage therapy facilities and best of all the bathroom! The shower and amenities are certainly 5 Star!,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,"The Qantas international terminal business class lounge is a lazy imitation of it's counterparts. There is a lack of service generally, the bar is self service and the variety of food offerings are minimal. The lounge seems to have more in common with the lounge at the leisure destination on the Gold coast than the Qantas lounge in Singapore. Traveling with a young child, I headed for the kids corner to keep our daughter entertained as we prepared for our flight. In this case the 'corner' was very much that, distant from the lounge proper so that a responsible parent flying solo with their kids is unable to get away to the bar or food counter to get any meals without packing everything up and lugging it all with them. There was no offer from the lounge staff to watch our bags, entertain the kids briefly or to bring any food or drinks. What was available in the kids corner was adequate but a few TVs and some toys and beanbags are not especially creative or novel. These small touches make a big difference. While the lounge offers a quiet place to relax before a flight, it could be improved to bring it up to scratch and meet expectations.",Sydney Airport,5.0,3,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,yes
Qantas Airways,"Food options in the lounge were terrible, and in much need of an upgrade overall which I understand is coming. Very little natural light, and found it quite depressing. Internet was appallingly slow also. Ended up leaving and spending time in the departure. More vibrant, well lit, and much better food options!",Auckland Airport,3.0,3,4,2.0,1.0,3.1,2.0,3.3,no
Qantas Airways,"Lounge was clean, comfortable and staff were very polite and friendly. On our visit on 9 July 2015 there was a high number of children in the lounge (families like ourselves travelling) which made things rather congested given the small lounge size. Unsure if this was usual given it was the end of Australian school holidays. Food was limited, but fresh and of good quality. Once again the lounge was heavily congested, so this may account for the limited availability of food. Lounge was located very close to Qantas boarding gates and only a short distance from a dedicated smoking room which makes things easy if you happen to be a smoker.",Tokyo Narita Airport,9.0,4,5,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,"Business Lounge is very modern. Once you walk into the Qantas Club, the assistant will direct you to a non-see through door that is marked 'Business'. It also labels the access criteria. This feature makes it feel exclusive. The lounge is less than half the size of the Qantas Club, however, it serves more substantial food. It is hard to get into the lounge because you must be flying Business Class or one of Qantas', Emirates, Oneworld Platinum member. The lounge has its own business centre and mini library. It is a big step up from the a Melbourne Qantas Club",Melbourne Airport,9.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Qantas Airways,"The lounge is very spacious. I don't get why there isn't a Business Lounge. The usual food choices are available, such as pastas and salads. There is a barista in the morning and from 5pm there is a bar. Boarding calls are made. The lounge can be busy at times because it is also used as an International lounge for Air New Zealand, Malaysia Airlines and Cathay Pacific.",Adelaide Airport,7.0,3,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,yes
Qantas Airways,This lounge is very old and inadequate for the volume of passengers that attempt to enter. At peak times the staff are literally forced to send eligible passengers away due to capacity constraints. Staff often get out their office desk chairs for use of the passengers due to lack of seating. All flights are morning flights so there is an adequate selection of food and drink and the staff are great! Unfortunately though they are constantly having to face the onslaught of disappointed guests who are barred from entry. Qantas have upped their flights but done nothing to sustain the surge.,Honolulu Airport,3.0,1,5,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,This lounge is totally inadequate for the number of people. Was there for the QF 11. Nowhere to sit comfortably people sleeping across 2 chairs long barista queue. As these lounges have now become one world they are beginning to resemble upmarket train waiting rooms,Sydney Airport,3.0,2,3,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,yes
Qantas Airways,This lounge was superb. Lots of space with different zones clean great furniture and design good bar area. Qantas/ one world airlines have spent money on this and it is world class. The only gripe is the number of showers- there are too few for the number of passengers arriving from Australia - Sydney Melbourne and Brisbane all arrive at roughly the same time to connect with the New York flight so the wait is too long. Otherwise can't fault this lounge.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,What an awful lounge- crowded awful food and service. The food was sparse it kept running out and took ages before they replenished. No glasses available and when I told the staff she brought out 1 glass for me rather than refill the glass tray! There was even a queue for the toilet. Again too small for all one world customers.,New York JFK Airport,2.0,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,no
Qantas Airways,Qantas really has diminished the value of Club membership. While the staff were very polite and helpful this lounge (like a growing number in the Qantas group) offered little other than a clean place to sit. Hardly worth the extravagant joining and annual fees. Extremely limited offering of food - even less than you would find in a domestic club on the Australian mainland. We ended up buying food from one of the Cafes outside. I managed to get a quick look into a couple of the other Auckland lounges. Qantas should be embarrassed and ashamed of what they offer their Club members.,Auckland Airport,2.0,4,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,no
Qantas Airways,Arrived at Sydney airport on Good Friday morning tired and needing a place to rest refresh and have a cup of tea.

Qantas Airways,Was a relief to visit this lounge after finding our connecting flight was two hours late. Staff was very good from entry to inside.

The food wasn't great plenty of beverages.,Hong Kong Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Day flight to Singapore the lounge was actually pretty quiet. Food selection (breakfast) was pretty good and actually tasty. Lounge itself is really starting to look old and some of the chairs very ratty indeed. Good selection of local newspapers etc to read staff service was good. Its time to update this Business Lounge it needs a good going over which has been the case now for the past 3 years.,Brisbane Airport,3.0,3,3,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Compared to Hong Kong Qantas Singapore Lounge is not up to the job. Very sterile place indeed chairs look horrible and are horrible to seat in. Food selection if its Neil Perry its not up to it at all. Bar is good service is okay. Toilets and showers are good whilst there is a good selection of Australian newspapers etc to read. Overall compared to the Qantas Hong Kong Business Lounge the Singapore Lounge falls down badly indeed in terms of looks and quality offered.,Singapore Changi Airport,3.0,2,4,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,no
Qantas Airways,It appears there is only a club lounge at Brisbane Airport and it is an utter disgrace overcrowded. We asked for the business lounge and told that was it many people had to leave as there just wasn't any room.

Qantas Airways,It is ages since I have been greeted on entering a lounge with genuinely smiling faces and the offer of drinks. There is a bar serving the signature dish and a choice of good Australian wines. It's a very casual dining option if you dont want to sit at a table. The food was generally good with healthy options available and a menu to reflect time of day.,Hong Kong Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,yes

Qantas Airways,A rather packed lounge with lots of chairs but no view of the apron or runway so boring! Freezing cold (outside was a heatwave) and when I mentioned this a member of staff said that everyone had complained - so do something about it! Several people left to warm up elsewhere. And why not? The food choice was not going to keep them entertained: there was no choice - rice and a stew. Little else in the way of food. Overall rather disappointing when you consider how good Qantas lounges can be (Singapore for example). It felt as if no one cared for the lounge.,Brisbane Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,no
Qatar Airways,"This is a beautiful lounge - huge with lots of sofas and chairs for rest between your flights. There are very few sleeper chairs around despite its size. The sleepers are found only next to the entrance to the lounge and just above the common area of the airport and near a huge billboard. So despite its intended use, it is not only noisy, you get lots of flashing lights from the nearby huge billboard. Despite having many staff around, nobody comes around to offer you drinks or to top them up. I was at one of the sofa seats downstairs and asked one of the staff if I could get orange juice. His answer  ""upstairs sir"". Not entirely incorrect but not very helpful. As compared to their lounge at Heathrow airport where the staff are not only attentive but much more helpful than these lot at Hamad airport, this lounge just doesn't cut it for me. However, food wise, they've got it covered well. From the restaurant upstairs to the sandwich bar downstairs, it is vey good. A tip for those having meals at the restaurant upstairs - there is a menu from which you can order food if you do not want to take your food from the buffet table - the staff just don't tell you about it until you ask for the menu. The lamb chop and the beef choices are excellent from this menu. The shower facilities are excellent if you can get past the heat - seems that there is no aircon in the shower rooms. Wifi connection is patchy at best. I've never been able to get a connection to view my home and office cameras in all the times that I've been there. I love Qatar Airways. I just hope that service improves at this lounge as I invariably spend a lot of time at this lounge waiting for my next flight.",Hamad  Doha Airport,6.0,3,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,yes

Qantas Airways,The Qantas Club Lounge was fairly acceptable. Very good food and drink with staff being courteous and unobtrusive. Nice showers except there was no bench or seat on which to sit down whilst putting on my shoe. The décor deliberately industrial was not inviting or comforting. Seats were OK but not great.,Singapore Changi Airport,4.0,3,4,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,As an Emirates platinum member I am able to access the Qantas first lounge while travelling on Emirates from New Zealand to Dubai during my stop-over in Melbourne. It is not a massively large lounge but has never been overly busy when I have visited and in fact has been very peaceful. The restaurant is excellent offering great food and quick service. The staff are brilliant without being obtrusive. I prefer this lounge to any Emirates lounge and enjoy the peace and quiet.,Melbourne Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Overcrowded dark noisy dirty full of rude passengers and overwhelmed staff. Was served scotch in a glass fresh out of the dryer so scalding hot. Was cut in queue at showers twice by pushy women with kids in tow staff helpless to enforce numbers as no one on desk. Has opened before it is ready and without adequate staff to provide service required of an international business lounge.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,2.0,1,1,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
Qatar Airways,"This is a new lounge at a new airport so very impressive. A good design feature is that it's right in front of you when you come through transfers so no long walks trying to find it! There's a nice check-in area with lots of lovely Qatar staff, then you go through to a nice water feature. There's a buffet restaurant with a la carte menu and bar above up a nice spiral staircase and a 'make your own' sandwich and salad bar in the opposite direction all serving alcoholic and soft drinks. There's self-service coffee machines and tea dotted around. There's a hideous smoke room for smokers, lucky I'm not. You won't need to light up, just walk in and breathe. Overall a good place to rest between flights with showers, free wifi, a nice quiet zone and I think I saw a children's play area. The duty free shops are down a long escalator below.",Hamad  Doha Airport,8.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,3.1,3.0,4.0,yes
Qatar Airways,"I experienced Qatar Airways London Heathrow and Doha lounges which were fantastic in every way from the food to rest rooms.

Qantas Airways,Qantas uses this as a shared airport lounge probably no choice. I suspect this was a oneworld shared lounge. Staff couldn't care less. The toilet had been broken into as the main door handle and lock were falling off the door. For an international lounge the food and drinks were woeful. The internet connection was difficult and rarely worked when connected just gave up on it. I wouldn't recommend it but there is no choice unless perhaps you use one of the paid lounges eg Priority Pass might be better. Seats were torn and the filling was coming out of many. At least it did have a flight status monitor. No blaring and annoying TV was a bonus. For an international shared lounge the reading material was very limited ie basically non existent.,Shanghai Pudong Airport,1.0,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Qantas Airways,I know it's Sunday morning but might the staff smile and acknowledge passengers? I always thank staff for clearing tables etc. and generally get at least an acknowledgement if not a short conversation. Today - nothing. Not hugely impressed as it's far better during the week.,Sydney Airport,4.0,4,3,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Typically disappointing Qantas lounge. Crowded grumpy staff and passengers sprawled everywhere with luggage blocking seats. I noticed many tables had reserved signs - in all my years of travel with Qantas I was not aware that it was possible to reserve tables in the lounge. Food was generally ok but long since cooled down. Plenty of alcohol but no bottled water.,Hong Kong Airport,3.0,2,4,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,no

Qatar Airways,"On my outbound flight from LHR to AUH via Doha I was allowed access to the fantastic main Qatar lounge. However, on my return to LHR just 7 days later I was told to use a smaller lounge for oneworld frequent flyers. I was dissapointed with this change in policy, as were other passengers. The smaller frequent flyer lounge has uncomfortable seating and very poor selection of food.  Undermines the point of belonging to a frequent flier programme with lounge access. On my return to the lounge at 3pm I was told they had ran out of champagne and spirits apart from Bacardi. There would be no more until a store was to be opened at 9pm. The point of going for an indirect flight with Qatar was because I had thought I would be looked after in the lounge. It seems this is no longer the case.",Hamad  Doha Airport,2.0,1,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
Qantas Airways,Just visited the new Qantas club in Darwin and it was fantastic and such a huge improvement from what was there previously. The design is modern with many seating options available. The buffet was well set up and the staff were clearing by tray which looked and felt premium. I enjoyed a barista coffee then took a shower prior to my flight in a very comfortable shower room. Everything was perfect and was matched by the engaging staff to welcome me and then farewell on boarding with a bowl of mints nice touch. Great work with this new lounge Qantas.,Darwin Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Used this lounge flying into Australia. We entered the lounge probably about 9.30 at night and there was hardly anyone in there - probably no more than thirty people. The place is huge very stark and industrial looking. As we were flying Jetstar I wisely decided to eat before the flight. Plenty of food on offer and ate from the hot buffet black pepper chicken and delicious crispy skin mashed potato. My friend had the pasta and was equally delicious all washed down with a couple of glasses of champagne. Went back a little later and had individual desserts the best creme brulee I have had a really good chocolate mousse and a liqueur. Staff were very pleasant a comfortable place albeit a bit cold due to air con temperature but well worth the visit.,Singapore Changi Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,What a lovely lounge. Very pleasant surprise plenty of space lots of good food and drink to hand toilets and showers very clean.

Qatar Airways,As a Qatar gold member I am disappointed at the change in lounge at Doha airport back to the older previously temporary lounge. This lounge is not only too small and noisy but also crowded and uncomfortable with a poor selection of food and drinks. I have no doubt that these sentiments will be echoed by other Privilege gold members and I hope that Qatar Air reconsiders this change in order to maintain its reputation as an airline offering superior customer service.,Doha Airport,2.0,2,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,no
Qatar Airways,Al Mourjan lounge at Hamad airport in Doha is really impressive. However missing the old Business and First Class Terminal. It is so huge and far from many gates. I prefer the LHR Qatar Airways lounge. Cozy and more quiet. The restaurant/food were amazing. Very spacious and luxury seating area. However if you are looking for a chaise longue in the quiet area be patient - there was a huge waiting list. Also they forget to install A/C in the shower rooms. So don't have a too long and hot shower because you will be sweating afterwards.,Doha Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,yes

Anyone who complains about this lounge is simply impossible to please.,Doha Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,This lounge needs to be revamped as its showing its considerable age. The food selection has much improved when we were taking our day flight to HK. Hot breakfast meal available which was very good along with the freshly made to order coffee. Only gripe was the Apple Mac would not work and the staff could not get it to work either. Good selection of current magazines and newspapers to read though.,Brisbane Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,yes

Qatar Airways,Find negative comments about staff strange. We were waited on the whole time we were there. Most of staff were from Nepal and were very friendly. Good selection of food. We take on board about ordering sandwiches. Only real negative comment the lounge was a long way from our gate apparently 1km. No walk ways meant we had to rush to the gate. Perhaps you should consider having a board giving approximate walking times to the various gates.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Used the (almost) new LAX Oneworld lounge for the first time. Not having experienced the previous one I'm guessing this is a vast improvement on what it replaced judging from the publicity. Decor is pleasant & modern with good bar / food facilities (if very cramped). Biggest problem is the First lounge isn't yet finished. As a result the new lounge is like an overcrowded food court with people using chairs as tables and footrests for sleeping that's if you can find a spare chair. The overall noise level is much like a shopping mall. There are also only 9 showers which seems inadequate for an international gateway port. It seems destined to become undersized only soon after opening. Having flown extensively on CX through HK & EK through DXB this lounge falls far short of those facilities. The biggest issue is zero privacy or quiet space which are what most long-haul business travellers crave and get in those cities. I guess considering the hell American air travellers endure in North America it's probably a welcome haven. But by international standards it's a falls quite a way short of the mark. Here's hoping the new First lounge makes amends when finished.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,3.0,1,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Qantas Airways,I had a late PM flight with a OneWorld partner. The lounge was quite empty but it had a lovely ambience. I didn't really pay much attention to the food due to how late it was but I had a small plate of cheese and some lovely sparkling wine (and then a Jamieson as a night cap). It was extremely welcoming and lovely to be away from the disaster that is currently Brisbane International Airport with the renovation happening on L3. The bathroom was spotless and the few staff around were pleasant enough.,Brisbane Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Qantas Airways,The lounge is pretty spacious with plenty of seating. I arrived at 3:30 pm for a 5:30 flight so had a good couple of hours here. Bar has a very good selection with some nice red and whites. A good selection of beer both local and international. Also a good selection of spirits and liqueurs. The food on the other hand is terrible. Qantas should be ashamed to offer this level of food to business customers. You could be forgiven in thinking that you are eating a sizzler. Actually that would be better. The toilets are clean but the place has a little bit of age. If you are paying a Qantas club lounge membership then you will be disappointed. Auckland airport in general is better fitted out than the lounge.,Auckland Airport,3.0,3,3,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,no
Qatar Airways,Long narrow lounge. Bar a long way from food. Easy to miss the bar Noisy. At least we got a seat. Puzzled why we are sometimes sent to different lounges. Food nothing special. Airport a nightmare.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,2.0,2,3,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no
Qatar Airways,Whilst there is a lot to be admired about this lounge it is clearly designed for business people who have 3 hr+ stopovers at Doha. I'm sure the a la Carte restaurants are excellent but my wife and I had less than 2 hr stopover and after you've made the lengthy walk from the gate had a freshen up etc the only thing we had time for is a cool beer and a selection from a quick and easy 'help yourself 'buffet (sandwich etc). The trouble is that this does not seem to exist because the food and drink section is located at the far end of the lounge and you have to put in orders for tailor made sandwiches. We did not have the time for that so downed a beer and left. Surely it would be possible to put a small selection of buffet sandwiches nachos crisps nuts etc for people who were in our position ? The lounge gets very busy around 11pm to 1 am and it was pretty difficult to find two seats together during that time though when we left it was a lot less crowded.,Doha Airport,4.0,3,5,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Qatar Airways,Wasn't expecting much. No natural light but there was a decent selection of hot and cold food. I just had some fresh fruit cake and water. All very pleasant. I was called to the gate 70 minutes before departure this was too early as I was just hanging about the gate which was too hot and had awful Mosquitos flying about.,Dhaka Airport,4.0,4,4,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Qantas' International First Class Lounge/Sydney Airport is one of the most best lounges i have experienced aside from Cathay's Hong Kong First Lounge. The separate dining area is amazing with many options and the personal attention is wonderful. Even later as I was there for a few hours prior to flying to Dallas I had some items from the self-service area which to me was quite an assortment of snacks to small meal-like offerings and beverages galore. Separate areas for computer use relaxing the library and of course views of the planes with floor to ceiling windows create private yet open feel.,Sydney Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,I was looking forward to this lounge as it was the first time in Singapore. I thought I was walking into a cafeteria all hard surfaces and noisy. The seating area was not that comfortable low hard chairs with low tables. The shower and toilets were ok but I was travelling with a friend who had been there before the renovations and said that these had not been touched. Another thing is the dress code (or lack of it) - some travel as if they are going to the beach. I'm talking of singlets shorts and throngs can't they buy a $5 t-shirt at least and a pair of joggers. Come on Qantas lift your game.,Singapore Changi Airport,3.0,1,3,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,no
Qatar Airways,An absolute gem of a lounge. Sit at the bar or relax in a comfy seat & enjoy the waited service the choice is yours. There's a choice of informal dining from the Deli or eat in the Brasserie - I chose the fillet steak with peppercorn sauce. When the food & drink takes its toll the 'facilities' are of quality hotel standard. All lounges should use this place as their blueprint; simply outstanding.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,On arrival the lounge looks spectacular. But it is too big and loses its exclusive feel. There are some comfortable leather sofas but too many of the seats are uncomfortable. There are two restaurants serving good buffet food which is of good quality but the Heathrow Qatar lounge has a superior offering with cook to order dishes. As Qatar Airways treats this airport as a hub with potentially long transit periods then a few more facilities should ideally be provided such as a spa and lounger type seating allowing you to have a more comfortable sleep. After paying good money for a business class flight I don't feel I should have to pay good money for a transit hotel. As M Clarke mentioned in the review below  there are loads of staff who hang about doing not a lot I don't want to be fussed over but it would be nice to be offered a drink or something. Overall a good lounge but underwhelming maybe I was spoilt at the Qatar Heathrow lounge but I think this lounge could do better given all the hype on their website.,Doha Airport,4.0,3,5,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,yes
Qatar Airways,A fantastic lounge the best I have visited and in my opinion better than the Al Mourjan lounge at Doha which I visited on my arrival. The restaurant was amazing with made to order dishes and superb dessert station - I don't have a sweet tooth but just couldn't resist. Very spacious and luxury seating area with staff taking your drinks orders. A minor and amusing point was the waiter (who claimed he was the barman) had never heard of port I explained it was similar to sherry but he was still unsure what I was on about (he sounded eastern European) in the end I settled for another glass of Bollinger champagne.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Very poor variety of food and drinks available. Cheeses were tasteless and bread rolls did not taste fresh. If you want something tasty eat before you get to this lounge. Very very quiet which some will see as a bonus.,Auckland Airport,3.0,3,4,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,no
Qantas Airways,New Qantas lounge in Terminal 1. Excellent facilities including spacious and clean showers bar with beer on tap adequate selection of wines and spirits and a barman to serve you. Extensive selection of hot and cold food including a choice of 2 dishes made to order and served to you in the dining area.,Singapore Changi Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Overcrowded great barista coffee and accompanying muffins avoid the basic boring usual items and wait for the good stuff on the plane. Breakfast is the usual fair chipolata sausages cold hash browns soggy tomatoes. Lunch is usually soup and a selection of rolls. The food in here doesn't match the decor even if it is hard to find a seat! Friendly staff make up for the lack of choice in food and beverages are pretty good.,Sydney Airport,3.0,3,3,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
Qatar Airways,First things first - to go to the loo when you arrive (not an uncommon destination I think) you have to go up a long ramp and then down another long ramp diagonally opposite then double back on yourself and walk another 30/40 feet; this is bonkers. Every time I arrive here I try a different seat - there is not a single comfortable seat in the place; there are a couple of nice leather sofas that look really nice but I've never been able to get near them because they're always 'full'. There are weird modern seats (very 60s - they look great) that are too low and you have to virtually lie in them or odd seats (that are at least higher) with big 'conservatory type' surrounds but they really aren't that comfortable. Then there are the seats beside the very fancy looking computer monitors that are at a completely unrealistic angle for use but although these seats look vaguely comfortable it's like sitting in a corridor. There isn't a scrap of carpet anywhere that I can see. There's what looks like a nice restaurant about a quarter of a mile away (seems like with the up and down ramps) and several tea and coffee stations and then at the opposite end to the restaurant is a deli. The old Ppremium terminal at Doha was lovely - nice people would pass by and ask if you'd like a sandwich and bring it to you with a glass of something. This place is absolutely crawling with really lovely helpful staff but they don't seem to actually do anything. Worst of all there is NO SPA free or otherwise unless you check into a hotel no hairdresser either. For a lounge purporting to be world class this is way off I think. I would happily pay for a massage and a shampoo any day of the week but there's nothing. I spoke to a member of staff this evening and was bemoaning the fact that you have to zigzag all over the place to get anywhere and that I loved the old lounge and she said she couldn't count the number of people who had said that. I love Qatar Airways but this lounge is a bit of a fail for me - a great shame because I spend about 4 hours here every couple of months.,Doha Airport,4.0,1,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,no
Qatar Airways,Qatar Airways is a spectacular company dealing with distinction its premium passengers. The lounge for business class is the best I have met in the world. Must impeccable service Krug and all the delicacies of the company's staff of care. Are to be congratulated.,Doha Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,Qatar Airways is a spectacular company however this Sao Paulo Airport executive class lounge used by the company is awful. All companies of the OneWorld use this lounge in the new T 3 in GRU. The catering is horrible the drinks have few options and low quality.,Sao Paulo Guarulhos Airport,2.0,2,3,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,no
Qantas Airways,I guess if you come from Sydney or Melbourne you are spoilt by the QF first class lounges which are amongst the best anywhere particularly on the catering front and I also guess you shouldn't expect anything special airline wise in the US but really the all in one world first class lounge in Lax is pretty ordinary. Given most really long hauls like to Australia leave very late one would expect an option to eat before boarding. Well you can have snacks but that is about it. The other thing about this lounge and the business class lounge is finding them. They are on the 5th floor but given entry through immigration at the tom Bradley terminal is a bit like entering the corridors of an underground prison the narrow corridors and lack of signage give little indication of where to go for anything. Incredibly on the 3rd floor which is the departure level there is a completely new world of shops and glitz so why can't Qantas get with the new Tom Bradley theme. The other thing is the very good BA/Qantas premium check in area is gone. Now if want to check in early because your hotel has thrown you out it is an all in check in affair which despite the sign saying business/ first class means nothing. For those of you have tried to understand the psyche of the US travel who wants to pay nothing for the airfare but then argue at check in for a first class seat delays can be considerable.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,3.0,3,5,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,no
Qantas Airways,Spacious uncrowded. Great food options including two made-to-order signature dishes reflecting the best of local cuisine styles in a lively eating area. Try a Singapore Sling - the equal of Raffles Long Bar version. Quieter lounge zone available for relaxing or laptop use. Fast Wi-Fi. Customer service service outstanding.,Singapore Changi Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Qantas International Business Lounge in Sydney. Lounge was very spacious very clean and staff very attentive with service and cleaning of the lounge. Lounge wasn't very busy which was a surprise. Food on offer was okay not great some more offerings would be good Beverages on the other hand were great. They had my beer on tap (Fat Yak). Overall pleasant experience and good relaxation before any long haul flight.,Sydney Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Qatar Airways,At present probably the best lounge in the world matches and exceeds other first class lounges. Modern extremely spacious food and drink selection simply amazing. Modern architecture all perfectly organized.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,Had a long layover here. Lounge is super impressive as far as the aesthetics go and the range of different seating options is good. The food was of a good standard: I ate upstairs and went for the mezze option rather than the a la carte. The staff were really friendly and helpful. I wanted somewhere to sleep and was lucky enough to get one of the quiet area cells. Not very comfortable but I was able to get a few hours sleep and a shower before the next leg of my flight. Overall a really good experience: felt much less busy and cluttered that the equivalent in Dubai.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,4,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,I was disappointed and alienated by the huge lounge sections which lack any cosy atmosphere and personality. Facilities are there but not always easy to find or access. A desert of steel glass and marble. It is far too big.,Doha Airport,4.0,2,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,no
Qantas Airways,For years this lounge has shared what must be a 56k dial-up Internet connection. For business travellers hoping for last minute skype e-mail etc before the 14-15hr flight back to oz forget it. Better staying in AA T4 and catching a late shuttle to Tom Bradley. It is consistently (6 times per year since this new lounge format opened) so bad I cannot begin to describe.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,2.0,2,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no
Qantas Airways,The lounge was great a friendly engaging welcome on arrival from the team at the desk. The lounge was very clean and tidy well stocked with newspapers and magazines. The buffet was well presented and I noticed the staff replenishing and tidying the food spills. Barista coffee was superb and the young lady serving had a keen interest in her customers. A great experience in a comfortable lounge which reminded me why reminded me why I fly Qantas.,Adelaide Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Was surprised how crowded the lounge was. Had trouble finding a seat. Good selection of food and drink and a pleasant view onto tarmac. Seating comfortable.,Wellington Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,The business class lounge is horrible for more than 1-2 hours. A 7 hour layover is an ordeal given the absence of facilities for lying down to sleep. If you find the quiet area tucked away just off the main dining area there are no loungers or blankets or pillows - but I was offered pyjamas! The room reverberates - too much stone metal and wood. The facilities are spotless and staff very polite and helpful.,Doha Airport,3.0,2,5,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no
Qatar Airways,This has to be one of the most dramatic interior spaces at any airport anywhere. The size of at least several football fields with several levels it is both restful and convenient. While we sampled just a bit of the food the mezze and the rest looked wonderful. We were there mid- morning and the space seemed almost empty. Staff were terrific helpful and informative.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,I was in transit for almost 9 hours so delighted that the lounge is now fully operational. As much as I loved the old premium terminal there were times when it would be so crowded it was impossible to get a seat but that was often due to passengers taking up a table and three chairs for the coats bags or newspapers no such problem now as there is a range of different types of chair and sofas spread around the bottom floor in different areas. The design is exceptional with a very nice water feature. At the time I' usually there the lounge tends to be quite busy when I arrive but after a few hours its almost empty. As this was the first time I' had any time to spend there I had a good walk around and bumped into two members of the staff of the old premium lounge who remembered me from previous times. There are two restaurants one on each floor a number of deli type counters and a few places where you could help yourself to tee coffee or soft drinks at any time. I tried a number of different chairs before managing to find an vacant sofa where I could stretch out for a few hours. Later I tried one of the work stations so I could use the USB charging unit each of the stations has a small bag of snacks and a bottle of water. I'd just finished changing the phone and reading the printed copies of the UK newspapers when staff told me that breakfast was being served in the upstairs restaurant. All the staff were helpful and friendly.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Qantas have now rescheduled most Asian flights for mid morning departures. Also departing at this time are flights to all New Zealand airports and South Africa!! Plus don't forget all the One-World and other carriers that also use this Lounge. You do not need to be a genius to work out that this means massive over-crowding in one small time slot. Yet another diminution of the Qantas brand. A previously really good lounge with great food services and staff but never designed for the traffic in this time slot.,Sydney Airport,3.0,2,3,4.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Unlike the scrum of the Qantas club through the door the business lounge at Melbourne seemed very sedate. We arrived at that time in-between breakfast finishing but being too early for lunch so there weren't too much food options available for us. The lattes were expertly made I have to say but would have been nice to have had some sort of biscuit/cake to go with them. Soft drinks were via a soda dispenser but the glasses are tiny - more designed for adding a mixer to alcohol than for someone wanting just a pure glass of Sprite. Plenty of magazines/newspapers to read or you can watch the world go by looking out the big windows that overlook the gates. Free and unlimited wifi was available in the lounge.,Melbourne Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Had a 2 hour visit to this lounge courtesy of Air New Zealand. Lots of seating with armchairs sofas and dining areas. Several TV screens with 2 large surrounded by comfy seating. Several shower/toilets well maintained and clean although unsure if how to get a towel if you needed a shower. There was a selection of drinks including spirits soft drinks and coffee/Tea. Overall there was a nice feeling to the lounge light roomy and welcoming. Unfortunately food was lacking in choice cold selection was ok salad cold meat and cheese. As for the hot food there was curry and nothing else. No choice and no rice to accompany the dish. This must be the worst business lounge for hot food choice anywhere. As for dessert there was a choice of chocolate brownies and lollies. Once again very disappointing. This would definitely put me off using Qantas Business class especially as this was the international Lounge. Overall good if you want to have a drink and relax but Don't go in to eat.,Perth Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Qatar Airways,The lounge is a great place to stay to pass the time between flights. The lounge offers wonderful food plentiful drinks and the wonderful showers.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,This lounge is very spacious and comfortable there are many areas and dining options. The staff are very helpful. But there is a problem with the lack of toilet facilities first time I've seen a queue for the gents. In general very good but I still prefer the old premium terminal.,Doha Airport,4.0,5,4,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,The lounge didn't feel exclusive and too overcrowded. Lounge open to noise of the rest of the terminal and very difficult to find. Had breakfast and food offering was extremely bland. I expected so much and was very disappointed. Compared to the Premium Lounge at LHR this is a joke.,Doha Airport,3.0,2,5,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
Qantas Airways,A zoo. Used the lounge on 6 July 0830-0930 en route to Singapore. The place was packed to the rafters and seating difficult to find tables a mess of post breakfast debris and the decor is really showing its age - especially if you compare it with the First Class lounge next door. Australians are great lounge users through the QF Club membership scheme consequently international BC lounges are heavily used by economy travelling but club member passengers. Domestically Qantas has come to realise that Business class paying passengers deserve their dedicated lounges away from the scrum of the club it's now time Qantas realised that international customers paying a hefty premium to stay loyal to Qantas.,Sydney Airport,3.0,2,2,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no
Qantas Airways,Visited early May and was surprised by the experience after reading some bad reviews for LAX. I assume this was the new lounge in the Tom Bradley terminal. There were 3 large screen TV's with NBA MLB and NHL being televised. Bar service great with loads of choice as well as a self service area. More than enough space before our flight to Sydney at 10.10pm in the evening with a number of laptops available. Food selection not quite as good as Emirates Lounges but still adequate. Definitely recommend.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,Poor air conditioning lack of food choices terrible internet (spent 45 minutes trying to download 17 emails and never actually managed it). Even the on-table tablets couldn't connect to the internet. Very poor in comparison to the old premium lounge.,Doha Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Qatar Airways,Qatar Airways new business class lounge is up and running and is quite exceptional. A simpler more elegant version of Emirates lounge in Dubai. I was there when it was not very crowded so it will be interesting to see what it's like when it is full - that was the worst part of the old premium lounge. The lounge has 2 dining facilities several snack areas and bars lots of seating a business area and as with its old premium lounge a lot of staff being helpful. Big and airy it is open to the new terminal but the noise did not seem to be a problem. There are numerous zones for seating broken up by architectural screen walls interior plantscaping and changes to the floor level. Most seats have a touchpad for announcements and surfing and a small set up of bottled water and simple snacks. Aesthetically the design is flawless.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,Expected more from the temporary lounge it is not close to the standards of the lounge at the old airport. Only 5-6 tables for eating the rest are small narrow tables with two electric outlets placed between two armchairs not enough room for two to place plates.,Doha Airport,3.0,2,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no
Qantas Airways,I fly in and out of Singapore on business frequently and naturally I was keen to visit the newly renovated Qantas lounge. Whoever designed this lounge has obviously never had to do business in an airport lounge. It has been transformed into a noisy cafeteria styled open lounge. The hard surfaces (walls and floor) create a vast noisy cavern with no consideration for acoustics. Qantas has completely overlooked the business class traveller here. There are no work stations or desk areas and if you need to print anything you have to go to the check in desk to collect your private and personal documents. I'm standing at a chest height bar trying to use the laptop as every table is full. If I sit down my hands are at shoulder height trying to type. Despite a good bar and what looks to be a good food selection this lounge is no better than the basic Qantas Club lounge in Sydney or Melbourne.,Singapore Changi Airport,3.0,2,3,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no
Qantas Airways,Although the first class lounge has been in operation or a few years now and the standard of service in the restaurant is first class (run by Sofitel) the amenities provided (moisturiser razors etc.) have all but disappeared. There wasn't even a toothbrush to be had and I had to go to the desk to ask for one. Considering what one pays for business and first class with Qantas compared to some other airlines I would have expected better.,Melbourne Airport,4.0,5,4,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Got a complimentary Qantas Club pass from my partner to use on my trip SYD-SIN-SYD last month. Decided not to use it on the lounge in Sydney Int'l Airport as it is always crowded but on Singapore Lounge. My choice proved me right the new lounge is great there are more seats inside the lounge with power supply and USB charging. Staff fabulous and tables are cleaned when guests left. Bars well stock and the buffets and menu are good.,Singapore Changi Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,The temporary lounge is a real shame compared to the previous one : overcrowded poor choice of food and drinks. Terrible when you have many hours of transit in the middle of the night. No wifi dedicated to the lounge but Airport free wifi very slow.,Doha Airport,2.0,1,2,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,no
Qatar Airways,Business class lounge was full with no where to seat. Very limited food.. Refused entry to the Oryx even though there own website states I should have been allow in.,Doha Airport,2.0,1,3,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,no
Qatar Airways,The business class lounges at the new airport in Doha are sill under construction and won't be open for another 3 months a fact you will only find out at checking as we did. There is a temporary first and business class lounge but access is highly restricted due to their limited space and normal oneworld status privileges don't apply. The temporary first class lounge is cramped hot offers a coffee machine with a few snacks. If you are going to be in transit for any length of time recommend you avoid the temporary lounges and head to the transit hotel instead or stay in the main concourse where it's cooler and less congested. I am very surprised that they didn't put the building of their new premium lounges as a priority prior to the new airport opening.,Doha Airport,2.0,1,4,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,no
Qantas Airways,Sydney International Business lounge is spacious with a modern decor. Around 13:00 once the lunchtime flights to LAX and Singapore depart it's quiet. The informal 'island dining' was pleasant and there were additional food buffets - including a very tasty Fijian style goat curry. The gelato bar was a nice touch - only 6 varieties but a nice after meal palette cleanser. There are ample Australian wines (no Champagne) top shelf spirits (but no malt whisky) international and Australian beers and soft drinks. A barista is present to make coffees. The staff were extremely pleasant - perhaps because of the early afternoon lull they had more time to interact with the few passengers waiting for the late afternoon flight to Dubai/LHR and were happy to have a chat. The vista is nothing special - though you can watch plane movements across the apron if that's your thing. Altogether a pleasant and enjoyable experience and a nice way to start a holiday.,Sydney Airport,4.0,5,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Had Use of this lounge on the way to Frankfurt via Ho Chi Min City as Vietnam Air and Qantas codeshare on this leg of the Trip. It may need a bit of an update with furnishings but the staff and food are way above most other lounges. The most impressive thing in this lounge is the showers and the selection of drinks both Alcoholic and non. People who complain should visit the Star Alliance lounge in Frankfurt or one of the lounges at Gatwick.,Sydney Airport,5.0,4,4,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Excellent new lounge for Qantas at Singapore. High quality service with skilled and welcoming staff. Very good range of food and drinks catering to all tastes. Personalised level of service unique to usual lounge experience.,Singapore Changi Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,Cost for the Oryx lounge is 40USD. Given the state of Doha airport whilst the new one is being constructed I think it well worth the money. Showers alone after a long haul are worthwhile and the buffet whilst simple is plentiful and the coffee good. Spacious clean and plenty of seating.,Unknown,4.0,4,5,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Qatar Airways,The Premium is huge but there are often too many passengers using it. Staff are very courteous and tried very hard and found tables for us in minutes. Lots of choices in buffet food and drinks. However quality on soup and hot dishes are so-so. Arabian snacks are impeccable and are worthy to try. Lots of bar stands for bar services. Bathrooms are spotless as staff will clean all stations before another passenger will use the toilet. The game room was closed and no one was there. The playroom lacks facility and was not attended. There is a Duty Free just for premium customers but there are not many exciting goods there. Generally cannot fault the Premium Terminal. There probably is not a better lounge than QR's Terminal. However they have raised the expectation too high that it is hard to meet the expectation. Hopefully they will have a larger Premium Terminal when new airport opens as they need a terminal that is at least 4 times larger than this one to make it a comfy lounge and allow them to continue to expand.,Doha Airport,4.0,2,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no
Qatar Airways,Check in staff were no help in locating airside lounge. Shared with other carriers it was comfortable but offered poor selection of food and beverages. Bright with airfield view.,Colombo Airport,3.0,4,4,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Compared to the excellent Business Lounge the First Class Lounge does not offer any additional value. It's smaller and at certain times quite full. I would recommend the Business Lounge next to it if it's too full in the First Lounge.,Unknown,3.0,2,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no
Qantas Airways,"The new lounge in hadn't opened on our way thru to HKT on 8th April but had by the time we came back on 16th April. What a disappointment! Being Platinum I was led to believe it was like the brilliant First class lounge in Sydney. Not so. How about no computers or showers! How about sitting cafeteria style with bowls of buns in spots along the table where you would have to request another diner to ""pass the bread please"". It really is just so average. We had to go back to the BA lounge to use a computer. I thought it was a First class lounge but it is open to everyone from Qantas Club to Business class and everyone in between by the look of it. On the other hand the staff were fantastic and will obviously enjoy working in their new environment.",Singapore Changi Airport,3.0,3,5,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,The lounge hot menu is Chinese. I am confused as to why Qantas feed their Australian business only Asian food. The only other things we could eat were Thai spring rolls with no taste. The drinks were nice and so was the fresh fruit. One Asian option is OK but everything?,Hong Kong Airport,3.0,4,4,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,no
Qatar Airways,Qatar Airways uses in Milano (Malpensa) the Sala Montale lounge (B-pier non-Schengen) for their premium frequent flyers and business class passengers. The lounge is marvelous. Its new interesting design gorgeous view of the airport aircrafts’ trafficking just outside the huge panorama windows overlooking starts and landings and a handful of international gates. The lounge is very clean. Furniture composition and art provide an elegant mixture of privacy and plenum options for travelers. On the minus is a stunning lack of hot dishes the only hot dish available is instant noodles. Snacks are many and drinks are even more inclusive of Italian champagne (spumante). Fruits and juices are plenty and coffee machines likewise. Italian cheeses salamis minipizza’s etc. could also have been a nice addition. Toilets lack shower but are well designed. WiFi is a bit tricky to connect to but works well once connected.,Milan Malpensa Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,yes
Qatar Airways,LHR lounge deserves the rave reviews. Excellent restaurant quality food and service with a knockout wine list. Lunch of crayfish washed down with a premier cru bourgogne! Absolutely no skimping on anything and everything works. Delightful staff with a sense of humour. Faultless. We felt vaguely guilty about such luxury! Doha premium terminal was busier but not far behind in quality. We had no trouble finding quiet seating on both visits. Both lounges are better than any others we have used in the last decade. The bus transfers to and from aircraft are a minor issue and actually interesting; problem solved shortly with the new terminal.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,Outstanding ambience service food and wine. The staff were very attentive and polite and absolutely charming.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Nice new lounge with enough seating for all at peak morning period. The staff were great with a level of service lacking in the bigger Qantas lounges. Food the same as everywhere else adequate but some variety would be appreciated.,Gold Coast Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Had the opportunity to use the newly opened Qantas lounge at Changi on the 10th of April and cant say that I was overly impressed at all. Cold uninviting and lacked any atmosphere at all. The staff however are wonderful and made up for what the lounge itself lacked. Am wondering who may have designed the space and secondly who approved it I expected Qantas to come up with a lot better.,Singapore Changi Airport,4.0,2,3,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,A very small but very clean lounge. Packed out as we awaited our flight back to Sydney at 10am from Honolulu. Service excellent food selection okay drink selection ditto. Toilets very clean. Only downside is the lounges wifi and business pc's both as slow as a wet week badly in need of upgrading particularly the 3 PC's. Good selection of Australian magazines and newspapers.,Honolulu Airport,4.0,4,5,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,First visit arrived from Hong Kong 0505 : huge airy lounge relatively low crowd plenty of lounge chairs & tables available. Hot buffet meals in restaurant area looked ok but I didn't sample. Food/bakery in lounge area had a small selection including breads cheeses yoghurts olives meat slices etc. Disappointed a true cappuccino wasn't available no decaf tea or coffee. Toilets staffed with several cleaners was very good. I enjoyed a refreshing shower. Second visit very busy took a little time to find a table. WiFi worked well. Toilets busy very clean as cleaner checked briefly after each person. Small dessert slices quite nice. Much more variety and quantity in lounge bakery - excellent. Still no cappuccino nor decaf available from bar. Overall an impressive lounge in layout and style but no decaf tea or coffee.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,A tale of 2 halves. Arrived outbound around midnight the lounge was packed and had to ask a member of staff to help in locating a couple of seats (which they did within 5 mins). The facility is good but is overwhelmed by sheer numbers turning it into a below average experience. Departed flustered and irritated. Inbound arrived around midday and what a different experience. Lots of space with about 10% of seats occupied. Tried the restaurant which had both buffet and a la carte available - good food and good wine made for an excellent lunch. Shower facilities clean and pleasant with lots of amenities available. Try and pick your transit time! Scores reflect an average of the 2 experiences.,Doha Airport,4.0,3,3,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Qatar Airways,Traveled through LHR-DOH-BKK and the same return. Outbound the lounge was very crowded with seats with two together hard to find. Disappointed with the lack of assistance from staff. This lounge is not a patch on its equivalent in LHR. Not a calm relaxing environment for a transfer.,Doha Airport,3.0,2,4,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,yes
Qantas Airways,I found this lounge quite pleasant. PCs etc were quite slow but food service was excellent. Its a very small lounge so its not hard to have it quite full but we found quiet seats where the PCs were. Toilets immaculate lounge very clean staff great food good given we had a 11am flight to Sydney. Lounge could do with updating but given that Qantas don't have many flights out of Honolulu its suitable for the passengers.,Honolulu Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,Lounge is very dated and showing its age with drab colour scheme and tired furnishings. However they have an excellent selection of food and wines. No French fizz but the Sallinger sparkling is very good. Highlight of my visit was the gelato bar. The staff at the desk and in the lounge were friendly. The wifi has finally been fixed.,Sydney Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Lounge absolutely packed out this particular Wednesday morning. Food just average like a domestic Q Club breakfast so left the eating to that on the aircraft which was for a change far superior. Barista available for coffee which was good. Used PC whilst in lounge also a good selection of current magazines and newspapers to read. Toilets were very clean.,Brisbane Airport,4.0,4,4,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Qatar Airways,Friendly staff who provided a service second to none. Choice of Krug or Bollinger Rose champagnes went down very well. Seafood platter was great with lobster and King prawns provided by in house chef Spent an extremely pleasant interlude prior to boarding after check in and official formalities Looking forward to next visit.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,Pleasant oasis for an extended layover. It was a little crowded at times with peak departures.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,A very impressive lounge. It is massive with loads of seating areas. There are dining areas lounging areas and snoozing areas. Selection of food and beverages is very good. Wide variety fresh and tasty. There is no reading material but WiFi is fast and free. The only let down is the bathroom facilities. 6 showers for several hundred passengers does not work very well.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Adelaide Terminal is a MASSIVE improvement from the old one that I last flew into. The Qantas Club near Gate 23 is pretty much brand new very spacious very clean and well laid out. A lot of people were using it the food selection was very good the service by staff excellent and the toilets were outstanding. Very very pleasant indeed wish this were the case in the Qantas Club lounges in Sydney and Brisbane (they need updating badly). The only issue we had is that if your flight is in Gates below 16 then you have a significant walk to make the relevant gate so make allowance for this.,Adelaide Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Qantas has got it right when it comes to bringing kids into their lounges. In contrast with BA's policy of counting young children as guests Qantas takes a different position allowing a member to bring in one guest and their children.,Singapore Changi Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Qantas Airways,I found this lounge overcrowded hot dirty and a little run down. Bathrooms were dirty with some stalls inoperative. Staff were unfriendly and even sarcastic at times. This experience ruined my opinion of Qantas and my preference for flying with them.,Sydney Airport,2.0,2,2,4.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,no
Qatar Airways,A joy - understated and elegant throughout and more like a hotel than a lounge. Though not the biggest there are areas for relaxing a cocktail bar a deli with bistro style dining area and a more formal brasserie. Attentive staff and the chicken satay I tried while sitting at the bar hit the spot.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,My wife and I had the experience of this lounge going to and from the Far East last month. Once you get to the Premium Terminal it is great. The only problem is until the new terminal is ready you have to ride around the airport for what seems an eternity on a bus. The lounge on the other hand was a welcome respite from all this. The personnel are friendly and extremely helpful. We found the same level of service both times we were there and each visit was about 12 hours different than the other. Plenty of seating great Wi-Fi fresh food and good drinks were all there in abundance. Qatar is a great airline and there Business Class lounge was a wonderful part of the total experience.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,This lounge is the only one in Male airport and it's ok but not great. The food looked as though it had been sitting around for ages and they had the air conditioner turned up a bit too high so it was very cold in the lounge. On the plus side they have nice comfortable seats clean bathrooms and a selection of magazines and newspapers to read. Certainly pales in comparison to the Premium Terminal in Doha.,Male Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Qantas Airways,Dreadful lounge at Honolulu airport. Far removed from the immigration check points. Food selection really poor. As explained by staff the only hot selection was toast. Lounge is cramped and dated. The male staff member was outstanding in ensuring that passengers were attended too.,Honolulu Airport,2.0,2,3,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,no
Qantas Airways,The Qantas Club at Hobart Airport is now inside security thanks to a new corridor but is still by far the smallest of the capital city airports. On my last trip to Sydney I visited the lounge and there was just one seat left. Due to the limited space the chairs are also squashed much closer than other Qantas lounges. On a positive note the lounge offers good views of the runway and parked aircraft.,Hobart Airport,4.0,3,5,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Quite basic and dark decor very dated. Food uninspiring and basic but then it was a very late night departure (nearly midnight) so maybe the options were better earlier in the evening. Lots of monitors to ensure you don't miss your flights. The bathrooms were not great. Overall pretty average.,Brisbane Airport,2.0,4,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,no
Qatar Airways,This lounge was an absolute delight. It was immaculate bright comfortable and modern. The staff were attentive and the food was of a high quality. It was not busy when we were there and maybe this enhanced our experience and also of course it is brand new. We were travelling on holiday and this was a wonderful start to our first business class experience. The service on the plane kept up the 5-star service. We did a brief stop on our return at the Doha lounge and it was a disappointment after the hype we'd read nowhere near our Heathrow experience.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,Had a half-hour to spend in this lounge whilst journeying from Melbourne to London Heathrow. The staff look wonderful with the females in the maroon Qatar livery and the men in their sharp suits. The lounge looks impressive too. However when you cannot even find a vacant seat and a request to a member of staff for help is responded to with a dismissive wave of the arm. It is evident that they cannot cope with volume and the purpose of the patrolling staff is rather lost on me. I found it quite ironic that Qatar promotes this lounge as being superb yet for me it was the major disappointment in an otherwise excellent Qatar Airways experience.,Doha Airport,2.0,2,5,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,no
Qatar Airways,On the outward flight to Bangkok only a short transit time but coming back over 8 hours in Doha and there is no finer place to spend such a long transit time. The business class lounge was quite busy when I arrived so I thought I’ll find a seat visit the restaurant when the crowds were less - big mistake as I fell asleep and by the time I awoke they’d finished serving meals. Although you could get drinks I missed a very nice looking mutton dish. The lounge was almost empty during the night and only began to fill up again early the following morning when more flights stared to arrive. The service from the staff was wonderful - somebody walking around checking you were okay. I’d only been awake a few minutes before a young lady arrived with a blanket. Qatar use the Escape Lounge at Manchester and one of the Thai lounges in Bangkok but nothing can compare to the premium terminal in Doha.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Quite a nice lounge with a good choice of food and drink available. Wifi available must ask reception for the password. Very clean showers and toilets. Staff service very good. Good selection of Australian newspapers/magazines available. Very close to the Qantas boarding gates in the G Concourse of Bangkok International.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,5.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Large and clean lounge. Excellent food and beverage selection. Clean and tidy showers and bathroom facilities. Overlooks the airport so you can look out the widow and see planes! Staff were pleasant on checking in however the staff working in the lounge didn't really engage in chat or smile as you passed by. They were just concentrating on doing whatever they were doing. A fabulous calm place to wait instead of with the screaming masses of kids and excited travellers.,Sydney Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Qatar Airways,As always a pleasant experience to go to the new Qatar Airways Lounge in Terminal 4. I tried the sit down dinner service the food was tasty and plentiful and the service great.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,Very fine lounge. Good food. As others mentioned no alcohol is available during Ramadan which seems unfortunate if inevitable. Very comfortable and soothing space - flight announcements aren't made but plenty of screens showing times and staff will also notify you. Showers along with razors and toothbrush are available in the bathroom. The one real shame is that there are not really any spaces to lie down and most people are traveling after pretty long haul flights often at odd hours. But none of this detracts from the excellence of the lounge. A real highlight is the quality of the service. Staff are excellent and seemingly eager to help - the contrast with say United Airlines could not have been more stark. The check-in to both the lounge and the airline is made as simple as possible. A real plus when flying Qatar Airways.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,During Ramadan it is totally empty no alcohol is served at all. Other standards are excellent but not everyone who travels with Qatar Airways is Islamic.,Doha Airport,4.0,5,5,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Excellent lounge - very warm atmosphere. The showers were spotless. The food was excellent and there was a very good range of both cold and hot food available even at the late hour of 10 p.m. Lovely Minestrone soup - piping hot. A very relaxing place - wish all lounges were this nice.,Brisbane Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Very well lit spacious areas and ample comfortable seating. Wide choice of beverages and snacks. The Restaurant Dining looked good ( though did not try ). Same for the Spa. Nice working areas with sufficient iMacs. In the early morning busy hour the lounge still had enough seating. Courteous staff.,Sydney Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,A quiet Business lounge located at the Brisbane International whilst waiting for our Hong Kong flight. Lounge is comfortable plenty of seating good coffee available selection of food is not so good very ordinary in fact could do with a revamp. Alcohol available even with a mid morning flight out. Good selection of local papers and magazines available to read as well as free wifi and internet. Overall a serviceable international business class lounge that could do with some fine tuning that would make it a wonderful start to one's departure.,Brisbane Airport,4.0,4,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,yes
Qatar Airways,Well appointed large area courteous staff but a few more signs would help. Travelling during Ramadan is a problem if your stopover is for any length of time and you're used to an evening drink. As alcohol was served on both legs of the flight we were surprised that it was not available under any circumstances in the lounge - we would have been happy to have been quarantined into non-Muslim section of the lounge or similar - to while away the time between 7 and 12 pm. I'm always happy to respect other cultures but it was the confusing messages that got to me and the lack of information about their services when booking.,Doha Airport,4.0,4,5,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Qatar Airways,Fantastic new lounge at LHR. Arrived from an 11 o'clock flight and promptly served breakfast from the buffet. The cook showed great knowledge of the food and ingredients served and staff responded promptly to requests. Seating area was spacious with choice of window seating central relaxing area with water fountain or TV corner. Very pro-active staff tending to customers needs through out the stay.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,It is an okay lounge. Has very slow internet but awesome catering. It offers drinks and snacks and overall it is impressive. It can get very busy though right before the flights to Australia.,Unknown,4.0,4,4,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Food generally of good quality. Food choices not always great (I might be a bit picky) - usually worse when changing over from breakfast to lunch etc. Drink choice excellent. Even when it's busy there's always somewhere to sit. Good view of planes and the city. Computers are great and wifi readily available. One of the selling points when travelling Qantas.,Sydney Airport,5.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Pleasant greeting and offered lunch on entering lounge. Very clean and comfortable with frequent offers of snacks - which were delicious. Bathrooms very well appointed and clean. Called for flight at the right time with staff lining up to say goodbye. A thoroughly pleasant experience in a comfortable and well run Lounge.,Melbourne Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,On arrival into Doha the lounge was jam packed (about 8am) though we did manage to find a seat. Nonetheless the food and drinks were tasty and in plentiful supply. The bathrooms were clean and virtually empty. On our return journey (about 11pm) the lounge was much less busy and so we were able to spread out a bit more. It's a nice place to while away an hour or two.,Doha Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,The lounge is in line with being a 5-Star airline. Good food good drink selection comfy polite friendly staff.. I would route through Doha anytime.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,no
Qatar Airways,Super lounge with maximum comfort. The staff is very attentive to your needs. The only small critique would be that the duty free area is somewhat reduced for products.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,The entry is calming and refreshing spaciousness captivating. A La Carte dining sublime for my wife and me the best was the PAYOT Spa. There really is only one problem with this lounge. It has set the standard so high other lounges we experienced were poor in comparison.,Sydney Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,No wonder no one uses the facility as there is nothing here - almost nothing to eat poor selection of drinks no restaurants. Qantas you are not the first class airline.,Singapore Changi Airport,3.0,4,4,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,no
Qatar Airways,Qatar Airways Business class passengers or Privilege Club gold Members may use the Lufthansa Business Class Lounge at Frankfurt airport. A medium size lounge sufficient choice of hot and cold foods generous choice of wines beers soft drinks. Wifi has to be paid for. Large choice of newspaper and magazines in different languages TV screens. I found staff in this lounge to be helpful and attentive.,Frankfurt Main Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,no
Qatar Airways,Qatar Airways use the Coral Executive lounge for their frequent flyers / business class passengers. A medium size lounge comfortable with a relaxing atmosphere. Beach view fax telephone wifi newspapers. No toilets in the lounge but outside on departure hall. Good choice of hot and cold food and drinks - although there seem to be no wines (beers available). Meet and greet service you are zipped through immigration fast track to the lounge. Excellent staff welcoming and polite.,Phuket Airport,4.0,5,5,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,no
Qatar Airways,Business Terminal is a must. Transfer from the aircraft to terminal is smooth and fast Lounge is huge and cosy with a good selection of food and beverages. Staff is very friendly and efficient. Wireless internet access easy but a bit slow. Lavatories are not up to this kind of lounge standards.,Doha Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,Great restaurant service and food. Spa service fantastic. I had facial this time. Plenty of drinks and fruit available. Internet service good computers available as well. Private office is good for some last minute work.,Sydney Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Qantas Airways,The One world lounge in LAX is as bad as the rest of the airport the First lounge bit gets so cramped before the night time international flights go out that they have to ask passengers via the speaker system to keep all seats free from bags etc so that everyone gets a seat- being cramped into a lounge area with several complete strangers is not my idea of First! Entire feel is shocking and while they have quite nice food options and Champagne the service buffet maintenance etc are not up to scratch during busy periods.,Unknown,2.0,3,3,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,no
Qantas Airways,Small and confusing opening times especially when flights are delayed. The lounge closes you get asked to leave and then can re-enter once it opens later in the morning. Comfortable enough with usual food and drinks. No coffee barista. Wifi works and cold drinks are cold.,Darwin Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Qatar Airways,The bus from the plane takes you directly to the Premium Terminal which has a wide atrium and divided into the business class section and first class section. The lounge was very spacious but crowded and busy on a Sunday morning. Had enough time to check out the food which has limited options on the lounge side but a full restaurant on the other. Quite impressive. Only downside was the busy washrooms. Shower facilities available. Adequate announcements were made for boarding and the boarding process was very smooth and efficient. Would fly through Doha again.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
Qatar Airways,The Premium Lounge has always been a great experience - you almost want a delay. In the past year the business class side has doubled in size which it needed. I spent 13 hours in the lounge in 8 days (no delays just long transfers) and I give it 100%.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Qatar Airways,A big difference noticed now that the business class section has expanded as it got very crowded close to midnight when lots of flights leave after this time. Separate set of toilets are in the news section also so this helps relieve the overcrowded toilets problem. Food is average as are the selection of drinks and not much choice for snacks either. Internet seems to be extremely slow each time I have tried to use it and given up.,Doha Airport,4.0,4,5,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Qantas Airways,Used the lounge in the morning for an international flight to Kuala Lumpur. Large and spacious but somewhat dark. Adequate terminals and wi-fi was available. There was no hot food on offer in the morning just a selection of cereals fruit and yoghurt. A fried or boiled egg would have been nice. The coffee was very good as were the fruit juices on offer. Toilets were clean and well appointed with showers for use. Overall a nice experience but it would have been nice if they had a hot buffet for breakfast.,Adelaide Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Qantas Airways,Used the lounge when travelling British Airways F-class from HKG to LHR. Facilities are fair but not really up to many airlines First Class levels. The prospect of trying to snatch a meal/dinner before the flight was very limited and aside from some snack type foods or soup there was nothing. Staff at reception polite and friendly but no other service really offered in the lounge aside from cleaning staff. Shower facilities are at the basic end of the quality scale and very mean in terms of the amenities they offer. Not a patch on other Qantas lounges in Australia and clearly BA tries (yet again) to save by using this lounge for their customers (not even any BA branding visible.,Hong Kong Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no
Qatar Airways,The dedicated premium lounge at Doha is large comfortable and well appointed. Food okay nothing special. Drink choices are excellent. The men's wash room only has 4 toilets and 3 showers. If your transit time is short like mine (1-2 hours) and you find the lounge is busy these facilities can become overwhelmed. So best to visit these facilities first before settling down. Qatar really need to address this issue soon.,Doha Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,Lounge is spacious and ample seating. The food selection while not varied was abundant for the lounge. Shower amenities excellent however a bit concerning to see mould growing on the tiled walls. Catering staff asked if she could make sandwiches for me - a nice touch. Drinks ample. There is not much of a view from this lounge but not a problem for short stay. Internet wifi super.,Singapore Changi Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no
Qantas Airways,Lots of free PC's and different types of seating. Busy but some seating. Really good range of drinks and snacks- no sandwiches but lots of hot food and salad if wanted. Very clean and lots of staff. Impressive.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,Qantas has hired room 5 above gate 21 which is a fairly large area. Lounge had a good feel to it with plenty of food and drinks available. Staff good and children rooms and business computers plentiful. Only gripe would be the lack of toilets. Toilets were huge one toilet rooms and the lounge only had two per gender. Seeing as this route has only been operating the last 2 months this lounge is more than adequate for the one Qantas flight,Unknown,4.0,5,5,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,no
Qatar Airways,Premium Terminal is a bit confusing to get to as the bus operator from the plane makes no announcements. Once in the terminal there is a limited duty free shopping area (much smaller than the main terminal's) and a few gates. Upstairs is the lounge area for premium passengers. Service is good as you are greeted immediately upon arrival. From there you can deposit heavy bags in the cloak room use (rather dated) computers in the business centre go to the game room or go to the First or Business Class lounge. The business class lounge has a large dining area with actual table service. Food selection was excellent for a lounge - with actual main dishes and an endless variety of premium drinks. Past the dining area are huge sitting areas for more passengers who just want to relax. All seats are singles though so don't expect to be able to lie down anywhere. There are showers in the restrooms but there are no toilets and sinks in the private shower rooms. This means that one must groom and finish up in the public area of the restroom which is a bit odd. Overall a very comfortable lounge but not much to do in the terminal for long stopovers.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
Qatar Airways,Still a great lounge although staff service seems to have fallen away in recent months. Buffet food has improved a bit from late last year but what makes me so mad is the poor internet / wifi service. Complained to lounge staff and they just shrug and say it is working fine!?,Doha Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,no
Qantas Airways,A pleasant lounge with showers and willing staff. Fine selection of food - wines not a great standard. Plenty of seating and computer positions. Sadly no view. Shared with BA - but few UK newspapers.,Hong Kong Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,Nice atmosphere comfortable lounges  great wifi stunning bathrooms but food choice very poor and no view or outlook.,Singapore Changi Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,no
Qantas Airways,An exceptionally good a la carte food service provided and staff are very pleasant. Excellent computer facilities. Very modern and clean shower rooms with high quality amenities. The lounge also has a very good spa and massage area. Without question a better first-class lounge than any others that I have used.,Sydney Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,no
Qatar Airways,"Had a long transit with redeemed mileage ticket Bangkok to Manchester. As frequent flyer - Gold - able to use the Gold lounge at Doha. Small but very quiet throughout- marble shower and extremely helpful staff. Seating limited to quite upright lounge chairs. A good selection of food almost 24 hours. One negative comment the ""quiet room"" in the main terminal is anything but with constant tannoy announcements.",Doha Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,no
Qatar Airways,Nice spacious lounge. Escorted from aircraft in BMW 7 series quick walk through security and into lounge. Enjoyed nice cooked breakfast fresh fruits etc - staff very friendly and efficient. Had a 4 hour stopover and managed to bag a bedroom where had a few hours rest before using shower room to freshen up. Good selection of mags/newspapers. WiFi was a little slow but internet terminals also in lounge were quick. Much more like a hotel than an airline lounge. Well done Qatar!,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Qatar Airways,Upon arrival you are directed to the First or Business lounge as appropriate and we experienced both (there being no first class seats available on our return journey). First lounge is an absolute haven - great selection of food and beverages comfy chairs and sofas sleep cabins if required spa and also a smoking room for those who require it. Good internet access although only a limited number of fixed terminals available - Wi-fi is free throughout though. Business lounge is similar to first but lacking in the sleep cabins and naturally much more crowded than First lounge. In both lounges staff are friendly and helpful and come around to announce your flight personally. Feeling a bit off-colour and in need of some antacid the staff directed me to the clinic where I was soon fixed up and got the feeling that they would have attended to pretty much any condition from which I was suffering. I think this is a great idea that should be widely copied. If you travel business class do be aware that the bus takes you to the regular terminal first so make sure you stay on board until you reach the premium terminal. This is no issue if you arrive first class as you are whisked from the plane in a 7-series BMW straight to the premium terminal.,Doha Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,I use this lounge a few times a year. Every time it is very crowded and thus noisy. Hardly a place to unwind before a flight or between connecting flights. In fact it is one of the most crowded lounges I use anywhere in the world.,Perth Airport,4.0,3,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Qantas Airways,Great breakfast options. Free wifi. Lots of reading material and seating options. Great decor. Only gripe was the espresso coffee machine wasn't staffed until I was boarding at 0800. The machine coffee was okay so I survived!,Melbourne Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no
Qantas Airways,Best lounge I've been in. Staff so attentive without hovering. Spa treatments are first rate. Food in restaurant is cooked to order. A very pleasant experience and made a 6 hour transfer very tolerable.,Melbourne Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,no
Qatar Airways,Transfer to the Premium terminal via Business class bus still confusing for first time users as the bus stops at the arrivals terminal and passengers are not informed they need to stay on the bus as 1 found out the hard way. New security measures in force on arrival into the Premium terminal - on clearing directed to First Class lounge. show to seats and refreshments offered immediately. Excellent service by pleasant staff. Area constantly cleaned nice to see clean tables not littered by previous guests drinks etc. Selection of both hot and cold food available. Able to take shower and shave in excellent shower room with quality amenities and excellent staff. Invited to board in a timely manner. Overall one of the best lounges visited.,Unknown,4.0,5,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.3,no
Qatar Airways,We had a four hour transit at Doha the cost was £14.00 each and certainly good value for money. The seating facility was spacious spotless and very pleasant to rest in. The food and beverage area was immaculate a good variety of snacks with hot and cold beverages being topped up all of the time even though there was no alcohol (Ramadan period). Towels were available for showers and the staff were all excellent and we would certainly use this lounge again,Unknown,4.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.3,no
Qatar Airways,Used business lounge in Qatar's new premium terminal in transit between London and Singapore and return. First point - coach from plane drops people at normal (old) terminal first - I thought there would be a separate coach for business class - we nearly got off at the wrong terminal as the information given is not that clear. New terminal is very impressive visually and well maintained. Reading material limited (on way back through early in the morning there wasn't any at all.) Would prefer a self service bar for wine/beers etc - there was a somewhat limited range of wines in the fridges available and no menus/drinks lists. Didn't look for or use PC so can't comment on Internet access. No announcements made staff wander round giving flight information and you can be sat some way away from screens giving flight info. Staff friendly enough but didn't volunteer any assistance. Given limited time available didn't have time to eat but there seemed to be a good variety of hot food available. Overall a very nice lounge but with a few minor improvements could be even better.,Unknown,5.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,A quiet comfortable lounge poor view outside. Food and beverages plentiful and good. I was doing some work with a colleague while waiting for our flight and found the wi-fi a bit slow but connection was easy and stable. Friendly staff who circulated constantly to keep the place clean.,Adelaide Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,Stunning lounge. Food excellent surroundings tranquil and very comfortable. The lounge features a wall of green live plants. Washrooms and showers spotless and amenities were first class. Dining was excellent panoramic view of aprons.,Sydney Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,Pretty decent lounge with reasonable airside view. Food selection is limited and expected more in an international lounge. Fairly spacious. Fast internet access. Overall 3-Star standard.,Brisbane Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no
Qatar Airways,Excellent atmosphere coupled with perfect service. If only airport lounges be this way. Service is friendly and confident they seems like well trained and genuine hospitable staff who cares. Attention to details is remarkable the flowers plats music and candles etc. Beverage service is excellent; my champagne came with few strawberries. Selection of food is somewhat limited but well presented with care. Spa is the best bit and after my 7 hours journey I had massage which was unbelievably good.,Unknown,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,Service was excellent. I had a long wait and after a very relaxing massage and shower I was tired. A member of staff spoke to me when I stirred just to check what flight I was on so he could wake me if I appeared to be sleeping through the flight boarding call. Could improve the amenities in the showers however for a first class lounge you expect female amenities rather than the more general ones.,Sydney Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,As per previous comments - a small lounge which comfortably accommodates a full business/star class cabin and QF Club members. Not a lot is provided in the way of television entertainment however food and beverages are well stocked. Staff are very friendly and only too willing to help. Wi-Fi is confusing: as this lounge is shared with American Airlines it uses their pay- per-use wi-fi. This service is provided free to QF passengers. Talk to the desk staff who will provide you with details of how to log-in. This lounge certainly beats the cramped and uncomfortable departure lounges in HNL airport.,Honolulu Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,Qantas Club at HNL is quite small but run by friendly staff who are available for assistance. The food and beverage areas are small but well stocked. I was there for a morning flight and was happy with the pastries cereal and fruits on offers.,Honolulu Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,Staff although helpful appeared to think keeping things clean was beneath them. The cleanliness of the place needed to be stepped up a notch for me. Quality of the food was average the fact they shut the coffee bar was completely odd. I was told to use a cheap vending machine? Range of wines and other beverages generally good.,Sydney Airport,3.0,3,2,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
Qantas Airways,A really small and uninviting lounge compared to the normal QF fare. Incredibly quiet - everyone was whispering! No TV internet. Almost no food (packets of chips only for most of my stay then a few sandwiches) and no staff noticed when the wine ran out. Why not use the BA lounge instead?,San Francisco Airport,3.0,2,3,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,no
Qantas Airways,A clean and tidy lounge - although by the time all eligible passengers are in the lounge it can be quite cramped and busy. It is operated by two staff who work hard when the lounge is full as it serves both JQ and QF flights including QC members traveling on JetStar economy. I recommend arriving early as access can be denied when the lounge hits peak capacity. There can be a lengthy queue to enter at times as there is only one person manning the reception desk and she must record your details manually as you enter. Food and beverage amenities are adequate. There is no television but there are 3 PC terminals. WiFi coverage is a bit confusing as most pax needing access needed staff assistance to log in. Overall a good lounge and an alternative to the bus shelter that is HNL terminal.,Honolulu Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,no
Qantas Airways,Crowded. One main seating area mainly lounge seats with some cafe tables next to the bar but also separate areas to watch TV. Very limited selection of food although could purchase some cafe style meals. Complimentary vouchers (2/person) for drinks. There is a small children's room with electronic games and computer. Bathrooms located only at one end of lounge which seems a long way from TV areas. Only 2 computers were available on the evening we flew (other 2 out of action) which seems inadequate for such a busy lounge.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,2.0,3,3,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,no
Qantas Airways,Never in many years of travel have I experienced such a bad First Class lounge. Was there mid- morning no food selection to speak of just cereals. Plenty of champagne though. Tiny area with not enough seats for the 4-5 flights that leave around 11am. Received a very late boarding call resulting in us holding up the plane as it was ready to leave. Compared to most Qantas lounges in the world this was disgraceful. Qantas need to re-think how they treat their platinum members especially considering that this lounge also caters for the EVA air flight and JAL.,Brisbane Airport,2.0,3,3,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
Qantas Airways,I was an Air New Zealand Business Class ticket holder and I was surprised the plane did not depart from T1 like most Star Alliance flights but discovered ANZ code share with JAL hence T2. Anyway I arrived from T1 on the inter terminal shuttle and asked at the transfer desk which lounge I could use and I was directed to the Qantas business lounge. I had a shower and used the internet stations. The choice of food was okay - nothing specatular. For a 30 minute use the lounge did the job well.,Tokyo Narita Airport,4.0,4,5,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,I have written before extolling the virtues of this lounge and there are none better. Have just finished a delicious breakfast of eggs benedict with smoked trout two of the best lattes I have ever tasted and fresh OJ. The staff here are warm friendly and helpful. It is the best way to start a 14 hour flight to the US.,Sydney Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,no
Qantas Airways,To be honest the QF domestic Business class lounge is not much different from the QF Club. Aside from fewer people and prettier light fittings almost everything else is the same. The so-called Neil Perry signature food selection amounts to little more than a plate full of fancy party pies. The obligatorily QF Club carrot and celery sticks also adorned the Business class lounge buffet too. I visited the lounge mid-morning and it certainly could have done with a good vacuum clean. Also noted that the tiles in the male toilets had been stripped off revealing the besa-brick construction (very attractive!).,Sydney Airport,2.0,3,2,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no
Qantas Airways,Qantas use the JAL Business class lounge at SFO as they do not have their own. As there are no JAL flights departing concurrently with the Qantas flight it is exclusively used by Qantas passengers. The lounge is designed with Japanese passengers in mind seats are small and lined in a row not in way that allows groups to sit and face each other. There are a limited range of snacks but plenty to choose from in the fridge. Bathrooms are clean but no shower facilities. Wifi is the standard T-mobile paid service.,San Francisco Airport,3.0,2,5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
Qantas Airways,I think this is the case where the hype is better than the reality. Whilst the Qantas First Class lounge in Sydney is very nice with its openness and design the lack of attention to detail lets it down. The first impression upon entering the main lounge - a dirty floor going up the escalator to the top floor. Toilets - not only was the floor filthy beyond belief but two out of the four toilet stalls were either not flushed or had excrement in them. When I informed reception of this they told me that they just had a lot of flights leaving. Is this suppose to be an excuse? If they knew this then someone should have been right on it. Nearly half of the computers did not work. One had a virus warning flashing on the screen! The restaurant had an excellent selection of food which was tasty and made to order. The wine selection was the best I have seen. Also the spa centre was brilliant! I had the best face and neck massage that I can recall. Although my wife was less impressed with her manicure. Overall this is a very good lounge but is let down by a lack of attention to detail.,Sydney Airport,4.0,4,3,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,no
Qantas Airways,Friendly and enthusiastic staff good service clean and well maintained and plenty of space. Good food choices - all in all a sense of really being appreciated.,Sydney Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no
Qantas Airways,What a surprise compared to the hideous Admirals Club in Terminal 4. Hot meals (chilli con carne chicken stir fry etc with rice and noodles) choice of 3 beers good red and white wines and spirits bar. Plenty of PC's to catch up with emails courteous attentive staff. Great shower rooms although the water outlets need replacement. Plenty of space in a quiet relaxing environment. Can get a little crowded when 2 hours from 4 flights departing. Overall especially in terms of lounges in the US very good.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,4.0,5,4,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Qantas Airways,The ambience is active but quiet. From the telephone call the day before asking us what time we would be arriving so the kurbside porter could help us with our luggage to the boarding of the plane all needs were met. My partner was wished a Happy Birthday from every staff member who met us at check in at the Lounge entrance and after our meal in the Lounge restaurant where my partner was presented with a small birthday platter of fruit. All this occurred by a mere mention of the event during my telephone conversation the day before.,Sydney Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,This lounge is immaculately maintained - as was stated previously can become somewhat irritating as they will pounce on a finished glass of drink or cleared plate - can't really complain though. The catering is slightly above basic with some hot foods and soups and the usual au dourves biscuits cheeses and anti pesto. There is no bar but rather a self serve fridge as in Melbourne and Sydney international business lounges and a few post-mixes dotted around the lounge. The wine-bar area and the open round tabled seating area near the main food area are great for socialising while the darker quite areas are adequate but the lounges are not as comfortable as they appear. Plus the big floor to ceiling windows which run around the far side of the lounge are great to watch the goings on of the terminal below. The showers are incredible probably the best I've seen in a non first lounge. On the downside the lounge as with QF/BA First Thai United Lounges a fair walk from the QF/BA gates and up a set of escalators and very hard to find. But it handles to steady flow of numbers very well and never feels full despite the time of day.,Singapore Changi Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,The staff were attentive and friendly. As there is no airside pharmacy in Sydney international a staff member actually took my script had it filled at a pharmacy in another part of the airport had it cleared by security and delivered to my table. Now that's service! The menu is the restaurant is short sharp simple and of excellent quality. The facilities are great I like that you can choose to use either Mac or PC in this lounge. They have a very nice day spa hard to get into but when you do very much worth the effort. The bathrooms are not that great but you really are not there to spend too much time in there. It's wonderfully spacious with plenty of places to sit. The only annoying factor was the number of children in the lounge. All in all a great place. This lounge is the only reason that I will continue to use Qantas it's a great benefit for platinum frequent flyers- Qantas inflight service could learn a lot from this lounge.,Sydney Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,no
Qantas Airways,Sydney business lounge very spacious with nice views. Food quality good hot food offering of soup and meat pies a little disappointing but cold meats cheese were of a high standard and bread was fresh. Lounge feels too modern could do with some nice artwork to enliven the space. Nice light fixtures particularly at the large communal style wine bar. Plenty of room to relax and find privacy if needed. Nice mix of seating arrangements. Nice showers. Overall a pleasant pre flight experience.,Sydney Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no
Qantas Airways,The renovated Qantas Club at Perth International is a vast improvement over the old one. It's looks and feels like the other Mark Newson designed Qantas lounges with the seemingly larger space punctuated with different areas serving different purposes. The toilet and shower facilities are also much improved while the food and drink on offer has not changed since the old days. The only major gripe would be the extremely warm temperature of the lounge which was acknowledged by the receptionist as being problematic.,Perth Airport,4.0,4,5,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Le Anfore handling agent lounge. Worst lounge I have been in. Very little food. What there is is stale. Staff are okay but not very happy nor helpful. Dirty toilets. Men's toilet did not even have a seat!,Rome Fiumicino Airport,1.0,2,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,yes
Singapore Airlines,"I was flying Turkish Airlines and as a Star Alliance Gold member I had a choice of a number of lounges. I tried the United Airlines lounge first as I heard some positive reviews. However also decided to try the Singapore Airlines lounge. I arrived at around 10.15am. As well as the expected English breakfast buffet, I was glad to see Chicken Sambal on offer. It was really excellent: chicken on the bone (or rather falling off the bone) and I added rice, hard boiled egg and chilli - I really really enjoyed it. I accompanied my brunch with a glass of champagne. The decor was very agreeable, lots of brown leather seating and a good view of the apron. The lounge is not as big at the UA lounge and it does not offer as much natural light. But the decor and food offering makes it a better lounge for me.",London Heathrow Airport,9.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,3.1,3.3,5.0,yes
Singapore Airlines,The Kris Flyer Gold Lounge in Singapore is miserable. The food hasn't changed for a long time and I am flying SIA regularly. No showers no rest areas.  A shame for a top airline.,Singapore Changi Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Huge lounge with a great selection of food and ample drinks. Superb showers that were cleaned after every use by the attendant and I was even whisked into the first class shower units as there was a queue and 'they didn't want me to have to wait'. Only downside is the lack of nap cabins or a quiet area for a long stop over. Internet was a bit hit/miss very difficult to connect to but worked well when it finally connected.,Singapore Changi Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,yes
Singapore Airlines,Very spacious lounge. The individual desk carrels in the back are extremely comfortable and ideal for work. Staff were quite nice. Food was less than mediocre. Biggest drawback is that lounge is a giant den with no windows so mobile reception was iffy at times.,Hong Kong Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,yes
Singapore Airlines,"The lounge is one floor down from the departure gates and there are no signs to guide passengers specifically to the the Silverkris Lounge (in contrast to SIA's competitors). Follow the sign that reads: ""Other lounges"". The premises appear tired and worn with what looks like 1980s decor. This lounge is definitely in need of refurbishment. The bright white neon lights lend it a cafeteria feel. Food and beverage offerings were limited by SIA standards.",Melbourne Airport,2.0,2,4,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Good variety of drinks. Decent selection of food choices. Chairs not exactly the most comfortable. Big negative is no toilets but it appears from other reviews that this is an issue with other lounges in this airport.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Singapore Airlines,They treat Star Alliance Gold Members as the lower class. Food is not nice no showers not comfortable. I wouldn't recommend this lounge to no one. Airport is nice but Gold Lounge is not comfortable at all.,Singapore Changi Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Singapore Airlines,A very comfortable if not undersized lounge for the demand placed by the mid-afternoon volume of FFs and Premium passengers on the A380. Food choice was 'good' at best however with the volumes of food offered on board the plane the selection of tasty cold bites and a few hot dishes was more than enough. Staff were exceptional and the hostesses circulated the masses and offered Champagne refills without prompt - a nice touch. The lounge is relatively well appointed but there was no spare seating capacity and I can anticipate this becoming an issue if other Star Alliance FFs flock there given the airlines reputation for high standards in its lounges.,Sydney Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Singapore Airlines,If you are expecting an experience comparable to the very good services provided by the silver kris lounge in a Singapore you will get a shock. This is a cramped unattractive space with limited facilities that does not compare well with Singapore Airlines overall business class product.,London Heathrow Airport,2.0,2,3,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
Singapore Airlines,The Port Lounge is a relatively small lounge in Kolkata airport but the food choices weren't bad (Chinese and Indian veg and non-veg including rice fish and other items); you could have a full meal. The alcohol selection is not huge but sufficient. There is a limit on the number of drinks per guest but no one was enforcing such a limit (if it exists). The lounge is clean but it has no view.,Kolkata Airport,3.0,3,3,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,yes
Singapore Airlines,"We were flying out on Silk air so my normal Star Alliance entrance wasn't applicable. So we used our priority pass card. The lounge was horrible. Stained furniture carpets exposed cables etc. The small amount of food there was looked like it had been there for days. No alcoholic beverages. The whole place looked like a 1950 soviet style lounge. Needless to say we left after 5 minutes. Then they had the nerve to charge my card $34 for each of us even though we should have a free visit! Do not go near Singapore priority pass lounges. I would give them ""zero"" stars for most choices.",Singapore Changi Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Very average. Every time I am here there seems to be a good gossip session going on among the staff loud and given it is not a self serve bar totally absent when it comes to offering a drink or being at the bar when one is looking for a drink. Much prefer the London lounge a business class lounge close by. Food looks like it has been sitting out forever and again staff don't approach to offer anything from the menu. A shame as Singapore Airlines in flight service is terrific.,London Heathrow Airport,2.0,4,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no

Singapore Airlines,Visited the Singapore Airlines T3 lounge at London Heathrow as a passenger with Thai Airways en route to BKK. Star Alliance lounge share. As always lounge was peaceful. Good flow of fresh foods with staff preparing more pastries when they ran short. A much better option than using the London Lounge suggested by Thai as that is a shared First and Business lounge.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Singapore Airlines,New lounge fit-out looks sleek. I travel through Sydney a lot and it was desperate for an upgrade. Staff are friendly. Food really average buffet was cold and tasteless.

Singapore Airlines,Visited on 26th December their new revamped lounge. Everything okay and considering they spent some money doing it up they did not really put any effort into the food side. What was on offer was cold meat pie cold grilled sausages curries that were lukewarm (beef rendang that did not even look like the real thing) Chinese congee that had very few condiments and a few other dishes of similar temperature. All served buffet style and obviously as time went by the food becomes less appetizing. Considering they have the Australian consulting chef Matt Moran on SIA's culinary panel why did they not use his talents to come up with something more original like gourmet appetizers rather than the same old tired food formulas. What a disappointment they did not think out of the box in the food department. I wonder why SIA does not win any awards as offering the best airport lounges?,Sydney Airport,3.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,yes
Singapore Airlines,"Adelaide Airport - we always make a point of arriving early at any airport and taking time then to relax (approx 2-21/2 hours) but Customs (international gates) at this airport do not open until 90 minutes prior to the international flight so we were unable to access the small Singapore Airlines lounge downstairs. We had assumed that as Virgin are Singapore Airlines ""partner"" airlines we could use their lounge. Definite not. The customer service lady only granted us access to the Virgin lounge because it was empty we have a Bronze Card and were over 60. Compare that to the excellent Qantas lounge that we had used in the past!",Adelaide Airport,4.0,4,5,0.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Singapore Airlines,The seating is ok and the decor is simple. This is definitely not the newest lounge and has very little atmosphere. Drink options are unimaginative and not impressive. The only real upside I have to say is that the food is quite good (not many options) - definitely better than the Economy class fare onboard so I always tend to eat my meal in the lounge. WiFi works but is not super fast. The lounge is kept quite tidy by the staff.,Taipei Airport,3.0,3,4,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,yes
Singapore Airlines,The lounge is far too crowded facilities dated and insufficient even for a 747 never mind an A380. Food selection limited to a couple of noodles and a few wilting sandwiches. As for the champagne don't start me on that. Even to wifi was intermittent. The lounge is not disabled friendly with an elevator which has no sides or back to the moving parts.,London Heathrow Airport,2.0,2,3,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Different from the better Changi Airport's Krisflyer Elite Gold/Silverkris lounges this one in London is a little bit dirty with some leftovers stains on the carpet more limited choices of drinks no proper meal offered only some tiny tasteless sandwiches and crisps. It's also a lot smaller and much more noisy compared to those in Singapore.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Travelling back to Auckland from Heathrow and after a tedious journey to the airport and then the bun fight getting through check- in and immigration etc we were looking forward to getting in to the Business class lounge to relax and refresh ourselves before the long flight. No chance the lounge was small crowded hot and rundown. The food was minimal consisting of packets of cheese a few biscuits some miserable looking sandwiches and the odd piece if tired fruit fruit. What a let down for a 5 Star airline. Extremely disappointing. Changi was better and so it should be as it is presumably their showplace lounge but not fabulous.,London Heathrow Airport,2.0,1,3,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,no

Singapore Airlines,This lounge has no toilet - let alone a shower! It was also very warm. Having got off a long flight from Sydney I was most unhappy. The whole idea of flying business and having access to these lounges is to have an advantage over the rest of the travelers. Not having a toilet and shower is ridiculous! The lounge pleasant enough and service very good but food ordinary.,Hong Kong Airport,3.0,3,4,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Used their Changi Airport lounge before heading to Sydney. Facility design is impressive but that's about all this lounge offers. Food are in substandard condition and beverages just as limited as the onboard offering. Too many people about and unsure if it was because I entered during peak times but it felt really cramped. Some tables still had leftover plates and drinks making it look shabby. This lounge does not have bathroom facilities and was told to walk couple hundred metres out of the lounge which I found incomprehensible. Lounge staff pretty much non existent other than at the reception area where they were rude and disgruntled. Very poor lounge to relax in and not worth lugging your bags into.,Singapore Changi Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Singapore Airlines,"Silver Kris lounge in T3 - it is a beautiful room ruined by despicable customer service. There were at least five staff in the front desk and not one smiled or made anyone feel welcomed. I watch in astonishment when ""elite"" passengers were treated like passengers on a bus in a third world country. I don't know if anyone from Singapore airlines will see or read this but the staff on duty on the night of the 1st of May 2013 should really be reviewed especially a short haired Eurasian looking lady. Wished I caught her name but really Singapore airlines needs to lift their game here. When travellers are spending copious amount of money to fly with you make us feel at least welcomed? Silver Kris lounge in T2 - I left T3 because of the overall lack of respect to customers. But what I found in T2 was the direct opposite. This is where everything came good. Staff were so polite and helpful. Goes to show that it does not matter how much you spend on perfecting facilities when you don't have the right people.",Singapore Changi Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,no
Singapore Airlines,The lounge in Adelaide is quite small with no windows but it is only for Singapore Airlines passengers so it didn't really feel all that crowded despite being small. One major advantage is that unlike all of the other lounges it is after immigration and security checks so once you reach the lounge you can just relax. The food and beverage selection is small but sufficient and the toilets (there are 2) are clean.,Adelaide Airport,4.0,4,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,yes
Singapore Airlines,Overall a clean and comfortable lounge (both in Terminal 2 and Terminal 3) with a good selection of food. There are no boarding announcements however so make sure to check your ticket for boarding times.,Singapore Changi Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Singapore Airlines,As a gold frequent flyer I was looking forward to relaxing in a lounge on the way back to Australia flying with Singapore Airlines. Given that Singapore Airlines is based at Changi I had high expectations of the lounge quality. However I was directed to the gold lounge that was very disappointing indeed. No service cramped seating flat beer mangy sandwiches and no toilet! I think that Virgin should look for a better code share partner if this is the standard Singapore Airlines have to offer.,Singapore Changi Airport,1.0,2,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Singapore Airlines,"This lounge was by the far the worst we have ever experienced. It was shabby the staff were rude or just grunted. There were only two toilets one of which was out of order and this was not even clean. The noise level with dishes being clanged and banged at the bar area was unbelievable. SIA need to engage in some serious conversations with Roma airport as the advertising states that ""the Le Anfore Business Class Lounge offers a haven of peace from Rome Fiumicino Airport. Treat yourself to the VIP lifestyle!"" - well it doesn't!",Rome Ciampino Airport,2.0,2,2,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Very average lounge. Chairs reasonably comfortable but no loungers. No toilets or showers in the lounge. Toilets down very quiet corridor which is worrying late at night. Good food and reasonable selection of drinks. Staff not particularly on the ball.,Singapore Changi Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,no
Singapore Airlines,One of the worst lounges I have ever been in. The staff were totally disinterested the food was stale and minimal and the lounge area very small with tacky furniture. Avoid this lounge its a lousy excuse for a lounge. I hope Priority Pass takes notice and stops ripping off customers in this way. Its totally not worth it.,Beijing Capital Airport,2.0,2,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Very good lounge - lots of food on offer though the selection did not change during my 8 hour stay. The seating was comfy and offering good privacy. The staff were very helpful and even when I walked in and out of the lounge regularly they did not raise a fuss and ask for a boarding pass. The toilets were clean with great showers that were well stocked. The wi-fi was easy to access.,Singapore Changi Airport,5.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Singapore Airlines,It was really disappointing to access SQ Gold Lounge at Terminal 2 and Terminal 3. No shower facilities available in either lounges. It mainly affects Gold member who transit in Singapore. Gold members are not allowed to access business lounge Singapore gold members do not usually need shower facilities at departure only these poor transit Gold members. It is a big disappointment. After a long flight a shower could make huge difference. Food and drink were limited you don't want to drink a lot anyway because there is no toilet inside the lounge. You have to go outside and bring all your belongings and come back again. So it is another strategy to encourage you drink less and move on quickly. It is really not a lot of point to build up your SQ points you get less and less for benefit.,Singapore Changi Airport,3.0,2,3,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Lounge is small with very limited food and drink on offer. Not up to the standard of other carrier lounges in Sydney. The restrooms are also very small. I left to eat some overpriced airport food.,Sydney Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,no
Singapore Airlines,SilverKris business class lounge at Changi airport is quite spacious with excellent choice of food offerings. The bar had a good choice of wines and non alcoholic drinks. Good wifi although had a couple of attempts at logging in. Staff service only mediocre as they did not bother to see who was there and kept pestering everybody in the lounge (a total of less than 10 passengers) more than once about missing passengers on some SIA flights. The place was rather claustrophobic without windows and did not have the general airy feeling that was usual at Changi. For a short layover I would just go to the lounge for the food and drinks but exit to enjoy the excellent airport that Changi is.,Singapore Changi Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,yes
Singapore Airlines,Sitting here at 1500 hours wondering what happened to SIA's famed food/hospitality. There is one member of staff for the whole lounge serving drinks topping up food (more later) clearing tables etc. The sum total of hot food available is a tureen of lukewarm leek and potato soup. That's it unless you like the one variety of sandwich available or scone and cream or microwave noodles. As for access it's a slog up the stairs or a ride in the service lift. Paint peeling off the radiator in the Gent's loos. Truly low grade compared with their rivals. I had more choice free of charge on the train coming down - bacon sandwiches scrambled egg and smoked salmon for example.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,4,4,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Excellent lounge in Singapore with plenty of room. Good food and wines on offer. Only available for Business passengers on C class tickets not to Star Alliance Gold card holders. Krisflyer Gold card holders in economy must use the lounge next door. Seems a bit off to not allow a larger lounge and have *G use the facilities. I understand that the First Class lounge is currently being renovated and therefore F pax are also using this lounge.,Singapore Changi Airport,5.0,5,4,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Singapore Airlines,Even as a solitaire member you don't get access to the first class lounge. The business class lounge is really busy on a Thursday evening waiting for the Singapore flight people had to stand. There is rubbish on the tables that does not seem to get cleared for hours. I don't know how much SIA pay for using this but it's too much.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,2.0,3,2,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no
Singapore Airlines,There is still a lack of shower facilities at both T3 and the newer T2 lounges for Krisflyer and Star Alliance Gold Members (SATS lounge at T2 is no longer made available to SIA KFGold Members). As the toilet facilities are located just next to the lounges additional plumbing costs and showers fittings would be at a bare minimum to sat the least - a real disappointment when a shower during transit will be a refreshing welcome between two long haul flights. Singapore Airlines are dropping their standards across the board. A real pity for a once premium carrier.,Unknown,3.0,3,3,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,no
Singapore Airlines,"T3 Business Class Lounge - as usual the staff at the front desk grimaced at all the guests walking in. I was there during breakfast time and the food was dry overcooked. Would have been helpful if they had some fresh fruits - even some apples and bananas on a plate would be helpful. I had a quick bite walked out of the lounge with the customer service staff staring at me. I walk no more than 10 steps out of the lounge turn to go back in as I left my jacket and was stopped at the entrance with a very brusque demanding ""Boarding Pass please"". Well at least she said please but honestly? If I did not live in Singapore I would never choose to take SQ as my first choice. Customer service is appalling unless you're a well dressed business man.",Singapore Changi Airport,3.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,no
Singapore Airlines,This lounge is disappointing and perhaps a reflection of how SIA views Star Alliance Gold fliers from other airlines - ie. poorly. The food service area is small with a limited selection of light meals. There are no toilets or showers in this lounge. So it is not a great place for a transit stop. In comparison the SATS lounge in T2 is a better lounge.,Singapore Changi Airport,3.0,3,4,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,no
Singapore Airlines,I prefer the old brown leather seats in the T2 lounge in Singapore - far more comfortable than the newer seats in the T3 lounge - especially if you have a longish layover. I see they are going to renovate the T2 lounge - I hope that they retain the old leather lounge chairs. I hope if they ever renovate the Sydney lounge that the keep the older brown leather chairs.,Singapore Changi Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,no
Singapore Airlines,I would expect a lot more form Singapore Airlines. Sydney airport lounge is appalling considering the levels of service Singapore claim to offer their passengers. with 4 flights per day from Sydney - and at present two of these are A380 services. The size of the lounge the seating food and beverages all very average. I was very disappointed.,Sydney Airport,1.0,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
Singapore Airlines,A bit of a journey to find this. Every drink ordered had to be matched to invitation card which was a bit of a farce as they did not keep them in any order. Whilst the decor wasn't special the food and snacks on offer were very tasty. Restrooms nothing special.,Dhaka Airport,2.0,3,3,2.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,no
Singapore Airlines,The ultimate horror lounge. I was there during peak hour at 11pm. It was so crowded that most had to eat/drink standing. Drink and food choice was reasonable but the size does not match the demand.,Abu Dhabi Airport,3.0,1,3,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Outstanding SIA Business Class Lounge in T3 with many separate sitting areas including one for catching a nap on a sofa. Staff gave me a blanket and pillow and noted my seat number to ensure I didn't miss my flight! Wine and liquor selection somewhat limited. Food selection was excellent with prompt removal of used plates and filling empty food trays. The shower stalls aren't as good as a few competitors but other facilities in the restroom area are very good.,Singapore Changi Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Very quiet and beautifully lit made for a very relaxing wait. the dining and food was great the bathrooms in the first class lounge were stocked full of great toiletries and fluffy towels. overall quite impressive I thought especially after the dreadful 1st class lounge that they use in Terminal 1 at Dubai airport.,Singapore Changi Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,no
Singapore Airlines,A small but well appointed lounge. Plenty of individual body hugging armchairs.

Singapore Airlines,Compared to other SQ lounges I have used this was very disappointing. Very small - was awaiting SQ220 departure an A380 with a full Business Class cabin so there were few empty seats. Decided to leave and used the adjacent NZ lounge. Many times bigger better food selection and facilities.,Sydney Airport,3.0,2,5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Spacious lounge with clustered seating. Very quiet. Had a good selection of hot and cold dishes and an array of beverages including champagne! Chic look but missed recliner cushy sofas! The washrooms and showers were very clean and attended to! Vast array of newspaper and reading material. Could do with a spa to go with the cool look and good service! The biggest miss was the view of the tarmac!,Singapore Changi Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
Singapore Airlines,"One of the best lounges I have ever used. Very calm and relaxed ambience. Lots of high quality seating available. Great food and drink selection. Free wifi. Server was down at first but after pointing out the problems I was having logging on manager at the business centre made few calls and had the server re-booted. Empty dishes and tables cleaned frequently. Shower and restroom facilities spotless. Lounge would be perfect if they had a separate ""rest area"" with lounge chairs and mobile phone restrictions.",Singapore Changi Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,no
Singapore Airlines,There are two minor problems with this lounge: the lack of windows - in common with most of the international lounges at MEL - and the fact that like most of the Silver Kris lounges it is looking a bit dowdy and dated. The amount of space was ok food and drink selection was fairly good and the lounge was very clean.,Melbourne Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Singapore Airlines,I agree with the other comments on here about the lack of toilets and showers - completely disgraceful. The lack of lockers for hand luggage is also irritating for a solo traveller as every time you want to get a drink or some food you have to haul all your things with you and potentially loose your seat. Having said that I found the service and atmosphere to be adequate and lounge felt relatively spacious. The food and drinks were fairly plentiful but a bit stodgy.,Singapore Changi Airport,2.0,3,4,3.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,no
Singapore Airlines,The lounge is spacious and comfortable and was occupied by another passenger and myself flying on SQ to Singapore. We were informed that free massages were available but unfortunately there was no one available. There was a good selection of Eastern and Western food available for breakfast with a good selection of Sri Lanka tea as well. Toilets were extremely clean with an attendant checking it after each use. Great view of the east side apron and partial view of the runway. Good customer service with SQ ground staff accompanying you to the airbridge.,Colombo Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Definitely dated and was the smallest business/first class lounge I have used. We were there for breakfast just before our flight. Food selection was narrow. The toilets do need upgrading. Another inherent weakness is that they do not offer to look after your handluggage/trolleys whereas in the MAS Golden Lounge you are granted the use of lockers. We were told this was for security concerns; if this was so then MAS would also do the same.,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,3.0,3,3,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,no
Singapore Airlines,This expansive lounge with its phalanx of greeters the subdued blue-lit translucent columns at entry is as appealing as it is enormous. Huge number of seating options from pleasant views out to the departure gates to snug corners for a snooze. The usual CNN slash ESPN flat screen offerings. A large selection of food; unusual for what you’d expect in a Biz class lounge (SIA has a separate wing for First). About eight hot options some Chinese some Indian as well as dry snacks. Lots of beverage options although probably on purpose the liquor is in a bar area quite far away from the food offerings. There was good scotch Champagne and some OK bar drinks. The array of papers was astounding: All the European dailies plenty of English offerings including a Globe and Mail. The bathroom is large with plenty of showers and has Occitane products. In short our lounge experience far exceeded our flight experience.,Singapore Changi Airport,5.0,5,4,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,no
Singapore Airlines,This was my first time in the SATS Star Gold Lounge at Singapore. It is big and has a reasonable selection of breakfast food (it was early am). The staff were very efficient and the lounge kept very clean. Not sure if WiFi was available but the lounge did have at least 2 commuter stations with web access. Unbelievably there are no toilets in the lounge. You have to go outside and use a public toilet. There are no showers either in what is a major Star hub this is unforgivable.,Singapore Changi Airport,3.0,4,5,3.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Agree totally with Mr Weiss (review 30 October). For a new home base lounge this is totally inadequate. At 8.30am it was impossible to find a private seat. For the one cooking station there was a queue - it really did not matter as there was no table space for one to sit down and eat anyway. I cannot imagine why in a brand new terminal this should happen.,Singapore Changi Airport,3.0,1,4,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Generally a good lounge with good seating area mind you some lounge type seating would not go astray as we had a four hour layover and it would have been nice to stretch out. WiFi is good but at times very slow. Food okay but have seen better in other business lounges. Plenty of space and lots of seating so finding a good corner not a problem. The showers are especially welcoming and staff are very helpful. They should have a wider range of wine as they only had Reisling on offer. Generally not a bad lounge but I cannot understand why Singapore Airlines do not announce flight departures.,Singapore Changi Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Small and dated lounge but with a nice view of the gates and runways. Food selection so so. However the washrooms were old and not maintained. The public ones were much cleaner. Definitely not up to SIA standards.,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Disappointed in the fact that the lounge overlooks the departure gates and has no direct natural lighting. The atmosphere and decor are pleasant. The buffet with a chef preparing breakfast orders is nice but the restaurant seating area is clearly insufficient for the number of passengers. The same facility in the Business Class section appeared just as overtaxed. For smokers there is an outdoor terrace located immediately outside the lounge entrance.,Singapore Changi Airport,2.0,3,2,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,no
Singapore Airlines,This lounge is apparently a new one opened by SIA. There is a long trek to it - too much of walking actually. The reception staff are warm and just welcome you but do not give much information of the lounge. The worst part is that the lounge does not have any toilets or showers! Something really unacceptable for a newly opened lounge in such a spic and span airport. Hot and cold food items are present and internet access is also free. Overall a good lounge but marred totally buy lack of toilets and its distant location.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,no
Singapore Airlines,Overall a decent lounge. Plenty of seating good access to TV and internet as needed. Selection of food and drink limited though of a good standard. No shower facilities observed. Unfortunately the level of service provided was substandard. Firstly the initial greeting at the reception desk was sullen mechanical and cold on both occasions I entered the lounge. Secondly there was no lounge manager visible to oversee the generally running of the lounge. This was evident by food bowls remaining empty for significant periods of time as well as floor staff (especially the male staff members) who simply loitered around the drinks areas and whose behaviour was unprofessional bearing on juvenile.,Singapore Changi Airport,3.0,4,4,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,no

Singapore Airlines,Small and basic lounge. Wouldn't have fitted everyone if business class cabin was full. Decor dated and showing its age. Very limited range of food available (possibly due to early morning departure). Too few bathroom facilities for lounge.,Sydney Airport,3.0,3,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,no
Thai Airways,The lounge is okay with one exception - terribly bad WIFI service. The service really only works very close to the entrance. They have a very complex username/passwd system that essentially is broken. On most devices you simply never get the page where you should enter the login information.

Thai Airways,"Thailand is the country in the world where the service is always the best as truly part of the culture (I've been to Thailand for 40 years!) but Thai Airways has totally forgotten that. Everything worn out (and by the way their domestic lounge is even much worse), food terrible (and I love Thai food), choice of drinks very limited (not one single wine but I was told by the staff that I could get some from another of their business lounge located 900 meters walk away) and staff barely polite.

Thai Airways,"I have been using this lounge for 7 years now and it keeps going downhill. The furniture is the same as it was when the lounge opened. There has been no upkeep. The food is very average. A few hot snacks like dim sum, and cold tiny sandwiches. There was one juice with no sugar, apple juice. no alcohol or beer. In the toilets the handle is broken off and the door is scratched and in poor condition. I will just stop using the lounge and wait at the gate from now on or go to a restaurant. It is somewhat depressing in there.",Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,2,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,no

Thai Airways,We were lucky to get there early (around 7pm) so we got the good seats. After about one hour the lounge was overcrowded. It felt like sitting at the gate with kids running and screaming and lots of people standing waiting for available seats. The food is not impressive at all. The drinks is low average (beer coke and waters). Its a bar at the opposite end with 2-3 wines and some drinks. Wifi works well. Staff is good and trying to accommodate. The restrooms are OK. Across the hallway (concourse D) is the Spa. This is very nice and quiet - great free foot massage / neck massage for business class (more options for first). In all fairness I believe this lounge would be a lot better to visit morning or mid day when less people. Overall it is better at the lounge than outside so I will recommend it.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,2,3,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Thai Airways,Used this lounge as a Qatar Airways customer - Thai Airways seems to be having serious financial issues and the quality of their lounges in Bangkok have gone down tremendously over the past two years. In this instance the lounge was grossly overcrowded with many airlines passengers. There were literally no seats available when I entered and I am writing this review standing up hoping for a seat. The beverage selection was average and the food selection well below average. The staff tried to help and were cheerful but were facing a much bigger crowd than the lounge was designed to handle or than the number of personnel could handle. Because of the big crowd the lounge bathrooms were rarely available and the general cleanliness was not good. I assume this is all a reflection of Thai Airways trying to rent out as many seats as possible in their lounge but I will not fly Qatar from Bangkok if the lounge situation does not improve.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,2.0,2,2,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,no
Thai Airways,"Nice and spacious. On a Friday noon we were at no time more than 5-6 travellers in the lounge. The selection of food changes at 11 am from breakfast to lunch setting. The presentation was nice and the quality was ok. The champagne was very ""brut"". Considering that CDG is no home base for any Star Alliance airline it is a nice and comfortable lounge to wait in and even with a limited view to the runways.",Paris CDG Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Thai Airways,Visited the lounge in Concourse E as I had a 8 hour transit between flights. The lounge does not have a lot of space as there are many seats in a relatively small area compared to some other lounges. however some different hot dinner offerings were available as well as plenty of alcohol to help yourself to. So overall I was quite happy with the lounge even though it seemed a bit small with many flights departing over the time I was there everyone seemed to be able to get a seat. I also used the shower facilities which were excellent and a great way to freshen up prior to the flight.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Thai Airways,Marginally better than sitting in the airport at the gate. Pretty average but at least I had a shower. Thai seems to be 10 years behind the times with aircraft on key routes and the lounge experience confirmed.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,2.0,2,3,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no

Thai Airways,The worst Business Lounge I have been in recent years. Food offer is negligible basically non existant wine is not on offer espresso machine better buy one outside - very bad experience indeed.

Thai Airways,Recently upgraded so the furnishings and carpets are new. The Business and First Class lounge reception desk is right outside the First Class lounge door so there is constant noise coming from the reception desk into the lounge . The hot food on offer looks awful and would be best avoided. There are no showers in the lounge and the drinks refrigerator needs repairing. The only upside to this lounge is that it is not as crowded as the Business lounge.,Paris CDG Airport,3.0,3,3,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,no
Thai Airways,A very crowded lounge at Suvarnabhumi Airport. The seats are okay specially the new ones by the entrance. They only serve snacks like spring rolls small pies etc. and sandwiches. They serve whisky gin cognac etc but no wine at all! We asked for red wine and one of the ladies working there came up with red Martini fantastic! You are forced to drink heavy liquor in stead of wine. I think it is the only lounge I have been to which has this very bad policy. They used to have wine and even cocktails but they have changed. We love Thai Airways but not their lounge at Bkk Airport! I really hope we will be able to get wine again.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,3,5,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,no
Thai Airways,Disappointing experience yet again. I do not understand why this lounge is so poor in choice of snacks and beverages for Thai's premium passengers. It used to be top line now it's below mediocre. I'm switching back to Singapore Airlines for my monthly travels to and from Bangkok. With SQ I get much more value for a slightly higher price all the way including on the ground.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,2.0,3,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,no
Thai Airways,"I used this lounge from flying with Qatar Airways Business class. This lounge is getting worse every time I visit. Despite consistent service at the reception and cleaning after customers the food and drink selection is smaller and worse. The microwave heated puffs and dim-sums are now ""not quite there"". They are left empty for at least 30 mins until I asked a staff what was wrong. Occasionally the staff would have a table full of instant ramen noodles. Making me wonder now if this was a true business class lounge or a ""free-for-all customers"" lounge provided by another neighboring airline. Most seats are still grouped in 4. Making it appear more crowded almost automatically.",Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,3,4,1.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,no

Thai Airways,TG in its hub goes on with a terrible lounge that has been there for a long time. The airport is very modern but the lounge is run down with old and uncomfortable seats. Food and drinks very basic; no wine no beer. No announcements which is standard in lunges but something unbelievable no screen with departing flights we nearly missed ours as it was miles away from the lounge.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,2,3,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,no
Thai Airways,Royal First Lounge prior to taking night flight with Thai to LHR. As usual the staff are plentiful friendly and efficient. I have only two negative points about this lounge. The first is the design fault which allows all the noise of the concourse into the lounge as the plate glass windows have large areas open to the main terminal area. This is particularly noticeable in the private sitting rooms. The second also relates to those sitting rooms. Although comfortable they have one draw back. It is very difficult to get the attention of staff without getting up and going to the corridor which runs along the front of the row of sitting rooms. Staff are always passing by but never glance into the rooms. This problem could be easily solved by adding a call button which switched a light outside the room. Possibly too it is time to at least clean if not replace some of the carpets in the sitting rooms.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,5.0,5,4,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Thai Airways,Guest of Swiss as they utilise this Lounge as a Star Alliance member. Crowded due to the number of member flights departing in the 2100-2359 period with seating difficult to find. Within the lounge only beer and soft drinks plus tea and coffee can be self served eventually the bar was located but in the odd location at the bottom of the escalators leading to the lounges (first and business) and before reception. Drinks are dispensed by a bar tender - two staff coping with a packed lounge. To top it off there wasn't a choice of white wine variety there wasn't any white wine at all! For a nation's flag ship carrier which has about five lounges at this airport to have no white wine is astounding and reflects poorly on Swiss which has no say in the matter.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,2,3,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Thai Airways,Found the lounge relaxing with plenty of cold hot snacks available alcohol beer wine and soft drinks available. Spent 3 hours in this lounge with a call at Royal Orchid lounge for a massage. Only complaint is the long walk from one end to the other for the use of the bar. Lounge was quiet so no problems.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,no
Thai Airways,The big let down with the Thai business class lounges is the quality of food they offer. This time I had a pleasant surprise in that they had some very tasty chicken tikka in the hot selection but the rest was the usual poor quality sandwiches hot dog rolls and restricted fruit selection. They also scrimp on some of the drink choices too - especially gin and lack of any wine. As a frequent flyer its a better than average lounge but if paying full business class fare I would not be impressed.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,4,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Thai Airways,My second visit to the lounge in 3 months. No improvement in the quality and choices of food and drinks. The food was unpalatable with such limited choices the lounge placed cup noodles as their best item on offer. As a Singaporean I am well aware that good quality food and drinks are very reasonably priced in this country so why does Thai Airways stinge on this I wonder. The seats are fine and the lounge is quiet. No showers or even toilets available you'll have to use the public toilets outside the lounge. Skip the lounge and head to the restaurants for better food.,Singapore Changi Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,no
Thai Airways,The main business class lounge THAI offer their Royal Silk passengers is a worn out place. The seats shows that they are very old and despite the free internet its hardly a place to charge the battery of your computer. I use this lounge many times a year but I am surprised every time I enter the doors. There are two other lounges available however despite the fact that they are newer and cleaner the relatively small lounges are often overcrowded.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,3,3,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,yes
Thai Airways,Spent 2 hours in this lounge at midnight with about 30 wide-bodied flights departing (including Star alliance partners). The lounge was packed full not one seat available. It had clearly been used for hours with dirt and crumbs everywhere. The food was okay at best a couple sandwich selections and some sweets but nothing special. Staff were courteous but don't give out internet password unless you ask for it (after you sit down and get situated its annoying to have to get up and ask). This is supposed to be their flagship lounge and airport- not impressed.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,3,2,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,no
Thai Airways,The lounge was quite clean and calm even though it shared with other Star Alliance customers. Food and Beverage selection was not bad. Plus the view from the lounge was superb.,Hong Kong Airport,3.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,yes
Thai Airways,The service is excellent the food offerings can be selected from an iPad listing and if you wish they book you for a massage in the Royal Spa. There was no aspect of the experience that I could imagine improving and the experience was like no other I have had.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Thai Airways,In Mumbai Thai Airways does not have its exclusive lounge. It shares its lounge with certain other Star Alliance Airlines. Celebrations lounge is not half as good as other lounges I have had the opportunity to be in around the world. It's like a 3 star hotel lobby. There's only one bathroom. The amenities are minimal. The food is nothing to be proud of either. But the courteous staff get full marks.,Mumbai Airport,3.0,4,5,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,no
Thai Airways,The worst international lounge I've ever encountered. A small yellow room overstuffed with chairs no tables a waiting room the size of a large living room. Food is questionable and limited alcohol is basic. I can't believe you pay business or first class air fares to receive this perk.,Manila Airport,2.0,1,3,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,no
Thai Airways,Excellent lounge but compared with their lounge in BKK it has little less facilities. (Shower other service). But food and view is absolutely better than other airline lounges in HKG.,Hong Kong Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Thai Airways,I've used this lounge fairly often I gradually seeing improvements to the rock-hard seats. Cuisines have now been added to most seats. Unfortunately in terms of the snack and drink options this lounge fares worse than a lot of other airlines. For some very odd reasons there is no alcoholic beverages offered. In addition to this light snacks such as nuts crisps or crackers are nowhere to be found. Wi-Fi doesn't seem to work due to the capacity has been reached. I would say for today's airlines standard this lounge is really sub-par.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,3,4,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,no
Thai Airways,I spent a dismal 90 minutes prior to an 0020 departure in this extremely poor business class lounge. Apart from the complimentary drinks almost everything about the lounge is dreadful in the late evening hours when many medium- and long-haul flights are departing. Finding a seat is difficult the seats themselves are small and uncomfortable the snack-type food on offer is decades behind what other legacy carriers now offer at this time of day and the reading material is limited. Next time I shall just pay to spend the time at one of the public restaurants!,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,2.0,1,2,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,no
Thai Airways,The service and staff are great but unfortunately there is no quiet place. Even the private rooms (with no door) are open to the public terminal at the back side with all the announcements in full volume. This Lounge is no place to rest.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,4.0,3,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
Thai Airways,The Thai Airways lounge in Manila Terminal 1 (MNL) is the worst lounge ever. It is tiny and everyone sits shoulder to shoulder in very small chairs. There is not enough seating to accommodate all business class customers. There are only a few coffee tables so you must hold your plate and drinks on your lap. Very few outlets to charge devices. This lounge is a disgrace.,Manila Airport,2.0,1,2,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,no
Thai Airways,Flying MH to KL so given access to TG lounge E. The lounge was dark and looked tired. Staff were efficient and pleasant enough and worked efficiently to clear plates and glasses. The food on offer was very disappointing. A few sandwiches prawn nuggets(!) dim sum dumplings vegetable pies a few miserable dry pastries and some fruit. This is Thailand so where was the Thai food? They had a god selection of liquor but no wine on offer. Wi-fi was good and there was sufficient reading material on offer. The bathrooms were small and weren't very clean and there were two shower rooms for use separate from the toilets. There was a reasonable view of the tarmac but overall it was not a great experience. I felt like I was in the lobby of a 3 star hotel.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,3,2,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,no
Thai Airways,Thai does not have access to a proper lounge and instead contracts with Alitalia. As such one is treated to the poor quality that Alitalia has become famous for. Limited food options consisted of dried out quiche some sort of bread and tomato pastry and nothing else. In fairness to Thai Airways this may be the best it can offer as Alitalia seems to have been given the monopoly on lounges in the terminal. All I can say is why bother? There is no service no assistance and nothing relaxing about the lounge. I was more comfortable wandering about the oppressively hot terminal than in sitting in the foul smelling lounge. Thai should make an effort and see what it subjects its clients to.,Rome Fiumicino Airport,1.0,1,3,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Thai Airways,The selection of food in this business class lounge is abysmal. For instance this morning's breakfast offering - as it has been every morning the last 10 years I've flown the airline - was boiled slices of sandwich ham hot dogs and boiled eggs along with an assortment of industrial-grade dim sum and tea sandwiches. I find TG's poor quality food inexplicable given Thailand's deserved reputation for affordable tasty cuisine. There are too few toilets many of which are out-of-service; self-service bar options have been removed with liquor placed in a service bar at the extreme end (outside the main seating area) of a 200 meter lounge; and the internet is often unavailable or so slow that Outlook hangs. In short give this lounge a miss if you have become accustomed to quality business class travel.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,2.0,3,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,no
Thai Airways,Thai Airways use the SAS lounge at T3 Heathrow which is quite big split over two floors with views out towards the runways. The seating varies from comfortable armchairs to bar stools  there are also segregated rooms for business use and a children's area. Lots of computer stations on the ground floor with a decent snack bar and a good choice of wines  beer and soft drinks. Upstairs each seating area had power points and wifi available to connect laptops plus another snack bar with a selection of food and drinks available including draught beer on tap. The staff did the job but not much interaction with the passengers  washrooms clean and tidy and overall ok for a short visit but would not want to be there on a long delay.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,yes
Thai Airways,We had the misfortune to visit the Alitalia Lounge which Thai Airways use in Rome. This would have to be the worst Business Class Lounge we have ever experienced. There was nowhere to sit when we first arrived even though I have to use a stick. When I finally found somewhere to sit the cream lounge chairs were filthy. The floor looked like it needed a good clean also. There was no food except peanuts and tiny biscuits. There were no clean glasses. Eventually some dried out sandwiches arrived which vanished as quick as they came. The staff gave the impression they did not want to be there and on the whole it was a very unpleasant experience. Is this the best Thai Airways can offer their loyal Business Class Passengers?,Rome Ciampino Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,no
Thai Airways,The lounge is a reasonable size for the number of passengers but can get quite busy. The layout is not bad but not the best compared to other lounges at the airport. Food is quite limited but the drinks available are plentiful and varied. The toilets and showers were modern and clean but no toiletries supplied  staff seemed hard working and friendly. Overall not a bad lounge for a short stay but would not like to be there on a long flight delay.,Perth Airport,3.0,3,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,yes
Thai Airways,The main lounge is quite large with plenty of seating but a little bit tired and worn  the other smaller business lounge is more comfortable with a good selection of food and variety of drinks on offer. Staff very friendly and willing to help  washrooms and shower kept in good order but can get very busy at certain times.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Thai Airways,Relatively simple functional lounge. Seats are comfortable' however the lighter colour ones are prone to staining. No sofas/couches. Food options are mainly for the Asian market (to be expected in Hong Kong) so doesn't leave much for western tastes particularly at breakfast. Nice and quiet on a Sunday morning as not many TG flights and I was on Air NZ. Offered a shower but declined.,Hong Kong Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,4.0,0.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Thai Airways,This is the Star Alliance lounge open to many customers. First impressions are not good: cold poorly lit and noisy (with low ceilings). Food looks poor and wine selection is terrible. No champagne few magazines: really a disappointment for a premium destination.,Paris CDG Airport,2.0,3,3,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,no
Thai Airways,The Royal Silk Lounge is right after immigration and allows for easy access. Staff nice and friendly and a lot of seats available. Food selection always the same and it is a pity they do not offer any nice Thai food only some snacks. Drinks selection is good. The location of the lounge does not really give good views and it is quite loud at times with announcements from the terminal building and one can constantly hear the moving walkways warning people that it ends. As we only spent 25min in the lounge before boarding it was fine however I would not want to be stuck there for a long transit. Next time I will try another Royal Silk Lounge at BKK.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Thai Airways,Good spacious lounge. A little dark but comfy good food available in the morning but only snacks not really breakfast items full bar available self serve and friendly smiling staff shower room is ok only 2 showers but wasn't busy when I was there.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Thai Airways,Flying a Star alliance carrier gave me a choice between the United Red Carpet Lounge or the Thai Airways Lounge. It was a no brainer and I opted for TG which offers a superior lounge experience to North American carriers. The TG lounge while not as good as BKK was still top quality. There was an assortment of hot & cold foods along with a decent beverage option. The lounge was crowded but there were still some seats available. First Class passengers have little designated private booth type seating areas and again it is less impressive than the TG 1st experience in BKK. I did have a chuckle though as the seating option and lounge experience that the 1st class PAX had was hardly worth the fare difference between 1st and Business. The only negative aspect of the lounge was the absence of electric sockets where one could plug in a laptop.,Hong Kong Airport,4.0,3,4,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,yes
Thai Airways,A small lounge with comfy chairs and toilets. Reasonable selection of drinks and small selection of food. Not many people in lounge as I was waiting.,Yangon Airport,3.0,4,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,yes
Thai Airways,Has to be the best First Class lounge. The service is second to none. From the moment you check-in they take you through a special customs area and down the escalators and then a buggy is waiting to take you to the lounge. My family was traveling and we had our own room and the service did not stop - we were there for 5 hours. There is a dining room which you select off the menu and so it keeps going on. This is the lounge you want when you have a long transit. When we arrived back into Bangkok from Rome they picked us up in buggies from the airbridge and drove us all the way to our luggage which was waiting the staff then collected and escorted us out to our waiting bus which took us to our hotel - did not touch our bags since we left Rome until we got to the hotel.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Thai Airways,I've had the unfortunate circumstance of being stuck in long layovers thrice in the last year at BKK. If it weren't for the high quality lounge I think I would have gone a bit batty. It's basically a very large lounge and mostly self serve everything. Also if you have a long layover the lounge offers complimentary 30 minute Thai massages which I found quite nice. Internet Facilities and speed is excellent. The food selection is mostly hors d'oeuvres type but there is many to choose from.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Thai Airways,The lounge is looking a bit tired and tatty but still clean and tidy plenty of food and drink with very attentive staff. No shower available but there is a spa lounge. Toilets kept clean by very friendly staff and glasses plates etc removed promptly. Flight info screens but no loudspeaker broadcasts which makes for a more relaxing stay.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Thai Airways,During our long layover at BKK we got to experience lounges on both concourses D and C. Whilst the lounge on concourse D was much bigger and had a slightly better range of food on offer I was surprised that to have a shower you had to move to the smaller lounge on Concourse C. Not very convenient when you're tired. The food and drinks on offer were of high standard and staff were cleaning the tables and replenishing the food. Except for the shower issue it was a pleasant long layover.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,no
Thai Airways,I use the Lounge in BKK at least every 2 weeks with same experience. No wines offered since years only fat puff pastry small Sandwich and Chinese Steam-buns Stale rolls Toast Jam Butter and sometimes cold cuts. Some cakes are available too. Either the puff pastry or the Steam-buns are cold. Bangkok is the Homebase of Thai and have the worst Lounge.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,3,4,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,no
Thai Airways,Modern and clean lounge with efficient and friendly staff. comfortable lounge seats good showers and toilets and a good variety of food (changed every couple of hours). The espresso/cappuccino machine did the job. Wifi was easy to connect to and fast. Low light : no wine in the lounge. Odd that. Not much of a cost saving if it forces passengers to consume the spirits!,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,5.0,5,5,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Thai Airways,We have used this lounge many times in the past and been more than happy. However this time it was a bit disappointing to see the quality had dropped. The wine and champagne selection used to be wonderful this time they were of a much cheaper standard. I have had better when flying in economy. They do offer a good selection of food and the lounge is clean and comfortable.,Brisbane Airport,4.0,4,4,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,no
Thai Airways,Not at all what you would expect from a Business Class Lounge. It was was understaffed most of the tables were filled with dirty plates and cutlery. The lounge looks old and run down. Very poor selection of food. Puff rolls filled with chicken mushrooms quiches and some very tired looking fruit. The selection has been the same for about 3 years. Thai airways Business Lounges have to be the only ones in the world without wine!! The airlines make a lot of money from their business class passengers so Thai airways should be able to afford to upgrade their lounges.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,2.0,2,2,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
Thai Airways,From the greeting at kerbside pick up where your luggage and check in are dealt with whilst you relax to the buggy that takes you to the lounge. The itself is spacious and clean with very attentive staff. We were placed in our own side lounge on our outward journey and then in mini slumber rooms on our return as our stopover was quite long. After sleeping we showered in the clean bathrooms then ate in the restaurant with all food freshly cooked. The Spa was sensational total relaxation. We were then escorted from the lounge to our seats on the aircraft.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Thai Airways,This is great lounge in the heart of the airport good for transfers. I prefer this lounge to the larger lounge one is directed towards on entering the airport. Having just done a leg from London to BKK I was able to shower in very well kept facilities before the last leg of the journey. The showers were powerful and hot towels large and fluffy just as they should be. I had time for a sit down and gin and tonic before the departure of my flight - my only gripe was the lack of a glass of wine - I guess a cultural thing. Wifi connection was easy.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,4.0,4,4,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,no
Thai Airways,A little oasis of quiet in an otherwise very busy terminal. The lounge is spacious on 2 levels with a variety of seating and some very nice Macs in the Internet Areas. I thought the food and drinks choices were pretty basic but okay for a short visit. SAS London Lounge makes T3 almost bearable - almost.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,3,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no
Thai Airways,The lounge was understaffed: one woman was responsible for cleaning and catering in the two hours prior to the departure of a TG flight. Many tables were piled up with dirty plates and cutlery and weren't cleaned in the time I was there. There were no glasses at all for drinks - you had to ask. Small and unappealing selection of baked items as well as cups of noodles. Spirits and beer available but no wine. A very disappointing lounge.,Singapore Changi Airport,2.0,4,3,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,no
Thai Airways,The least impressive business lounge I have seen for some time. Cramped dingy and full of mosquitoes. My family moved to the main waiting area one by one driven out by the depressing atmosphere frequent insect bites and noise from one extended family with small children.,Chiang Mai Airport,2.0,3,2,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,no
Thai Airways,The staff food and service here are all excellent. Staff most helpful with connecting flights. Great internet access very fast. Must be one of the world's best airport lounges.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Thai Airways,Great Lounge. I travelled Swiss First Class and thus was invited to use the THAI AIRWAYS Lounge. Unfortunately the usage of the SPA is only permitted for THAI customers not for pax from partner airlines. Welcome at the desk is very friendly professional. Seating is very comfortable THAI also offers separate suites all were reserved though seemingly for THAI pax only. The service is professional friendly and unobtrusive. All kinds of drinks and cocktails are served. At the seat snacks are on offer from a snack menu. In case of major appetite some main courses international and Thai dishes can be ordered and are served in the cozy little restaurant at the end of the lounge. A big selection of national and international newspapers and magazines is spread out. Also a nice touch for me a small smokers lounge separate from the other lounge areas is available and drinks are served there also. Finally a very nice and comfortable lounge quiet and giving privacy.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,no
Thai Airways,Not what you would expect in a Business Class Lounge. Over years still the same poor selection on finger food. Puff rolls filled with Chicken Mushrooms Vegetarian Quiches some fruit soup. They have a good variety on drinks but no red/white wine as most others offer. Internet access is quite good. After I visited a few times the Thai Lounge in Hong Kong I was even more disappointed about the Bangkok Lounge at the Home base!,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
Thai Airways,This Lounge has been open 3 years now and the earlier problems (poor air conditioning gloomy corridor like interior dreadful toilets) all remain unchanged - as has the snacks menu. Three years on and they still offer precisely the same collection of dreary sandwiches and pastries. The Internet Room appeared to be a play area for children when I visited. There's a reasonable drinks choice but not as good as the old lounges in Don Muang - they now have a small Duty Free Shop which is a useful provision. Perhaps they could channel some of the profit from that into fixing the problems in the lounge. Airlines make a lot of profit from their Business Class Customers and it would be nice to see some of this put back into the Lounge at Thai's home airport.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,no
Thai Airways,For Thai's Flagship Business Class Lounge this was disappointing. Though the seating arrangements were comfortable the long layout made it feel like you're sitting in a corridor. The food selection was pathetic; a couple of small hot quiches and sausage rolls a few white bread sandwiches and cup-noodles. Not what you would expect in a Business Class Lounge. Good selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,3,4,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,no
Thai Airways,The Best First Class Lounge ever visit until now. Welcome begins at the gate on arriving of the plane go by an electric cart to the Royal First Lounge. I was assigned a private room with large HD TV. 2 dedicated lounge hostesses for the services during the entire stay. An extensive menu is presented. You can eat in a 5-stars restaurant setting or in your own private lounge. You will be the last to board. A hostess will call personally for your flight and take you to the gate by an electric cart and to your seat on the plane.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Thai Airways,The First class lounge is an oasis. Attentive staff that really are taking care of you. Nice private living room area. Food and drinks on demand. The Spa for First class passengers is amazing with nice amenities and also a 1hr massage is included. Only wifi was a bit slow but and could not find a menu for drinks and meals. However it was overall a nice experience.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,no
Thai Airways,This is one of the best lounges worldwide. A lot of staff is caring about all needs. They have a dining menu with a wide selection of food if you want eat before your flight. Thai Airways passengers are invited to the spa where a free oil/neck and shoulder or foot massage is offered. But between 9.00 pm and midnight due to many departures the lounge is overcrowded and sometimes very noisy. The washrooms are very big with a nice selection of L'occitane products. After every use someone comes for cleaning.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,5.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Thai Airways,The main lounge is very long and doesn't really provide a very cosy feel. Staff are abundant friendly and attentive. Free WiFi access is available and it's adequate but quite slow. One gripe that so many of us have is the lack of power easily accessible power outlets for our laptops. The Thai lounge at Suvarnabhumi is fairly new and it's a shame that the designers didn't do what most modern airports are doing (such as NRT) and provide easily accessible outlets for every seat. One major bonus is the offer of a 20 minute massage in the adjacent First Class spa with options for either a foot massage or a head and neck massage. Perfect for relaxing just prior to boarding. My biggest complain would be the catering which is limited to dry snacks small cheap white bread sandwiches instant noodle and various small but rather oily warm pies. The Thai lounge really pales in comparison to their competition in this area. It's also interesting to me that the food catering is actually much better in Thai lounges at other airports Hong Kong for example where various hot dishes are provided and even ice cream. Even the dingy overcrowded Thai lounge at MNL offers a better food catering service. One would think that Thai's flagship home base lounges would provide the best catering but this is not the case.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,no
Thai Airways,Late transfer staff helpful directed me to a decent sized shower room (with toilet) to freshen up for the next flight ahead. Busy lounge with relatively few seats but quiet enough and clean. Very little reading material but ok to sit and relax. Food selection mostly cold pastry products and poor quality sugary desserts. Internet access through terminals that I wouldn't trust as PCs concerned had vast amounts of software that had been installed on them by past users. Biggest inconvenience is having to queue up for security between lounge and gates with no priority queue. Overall great staff comfortable environment good shower/bathroom facilities but needs a big rethink on food.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,4,4,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,no
Thai Airways,Am lucky enough to use the business lounge at Bangkok frequently and since the new airport opened I can say how much better the lounge is. The lighting is tranquil and soothing with plenty of comfortable seating. The staff are more than accommodating constantly replenishing the snacks and drinks and keeping all areas spotless. The washrooms too are very good and clean - always important when your about to board a flight and need to freshen up. All in all an excellent lounge with all you require before the start of your journey.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,no
Thai Airways,What an amazing service - we were greeted by Thai Staff as we enter the separate entrance to First Class check-in at the Airport. Our bags and tickets were taken and check-in completed by Thai Staff whilst we were seated in comfort. We were then escorted thru immigrations then onto a private buggy vehicle to the first class lounge. Truly amazing and beautiful lounge and extremely attentive staff. We were shown to a private room with lounge table working desk with wifi plug and flat screen tv. You could actually choose what you would like to eat and it was all prepared fresh and delivered to our mini suite. This is one of those memorable 5 star experiences that I will always remember.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Thai Airways,This has to be one of the worst First Class lounges I have ever been in. It was suppose to be a First Class lounge but I believe they were letting anyone in. The lounge was old and tired and in need of a complete overhaul. When I entered the lounge I was told I would have to PAY 10 Euro for the wifi connection. The best they could do for catering was a pizza mangled into odd shapes and pieces thrown on a plate. Seating and decor was very uncomfortable and out dated. I actually walked out to the airport toilets as the lounge toilets were a disgrace.,Milan Malpensa Airport,2.0,1,5,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,no
Thai Airways,Used the lounge twice in July and really quite impressed! Got a buggy ride from arrival aircraft straight to the lounge. Plenty of seats in the lounge but best part is the Thai Spa facility opposite - had a truly relaxing massage here and some health drinks that were just great. Staff in the lounge really nice and very efficient. Food not so good compared to many First Class lounges today and maybe Thai can improve that. Washrooms and shower rooms immaculate and nice amenities. A small sleep / quiet area but did not use that this time.

Thai Airways,Thai share the Air New Zealand lounge at Sydney Airport. My experience was not a happy one. This started with my being initially refused entry by the guy at the front desk because 'my name was not on the list' . Turns out he had the wrong list and was using the passenger list for TG992 from the night before. I must have been the first for the morning flight to Bangkok to arrive. Half an hour later I'm finally admitted but then met with noisy kids and a dull lounge. Better than no lounge at all but I did not stay there long.,Sydney Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no
Thai Airways,Used the Lounge before E Gate. Good beverage selection but boring Food selection. Never changed in 5 years or longer? Don't understand the 4 seat arrangement as most travelers are alone and use the time with their Laptops. Sockets are very limited. Often problems with the coffee machines which are full stickers and leftovers of tape glue. Aircon not very good as in the whole Airport. WIFI often crash. Friendly Staff and good cleaning of tables. Kids Playground available as well as Computer rooms. No Flight information screens available so watch your time. Overall I liked the Dong Muang Lounges at all locations much more.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,no
Thai Airways,"Classic Thai welcome on arrival - very airy lounge with more private areas leading off. Comfortable seating and a full dining area if required. Full choice of food - freshly prepared to order - do not help yourself! The club sandwich is as good as it gets. Full bar inc champagne but disappointed with the reds - no Pinot Noir. Staff will escort you the 50 yds to the Spa for a complimentary massage - well worth doing to ease jet lag. There are showers and private cabins with sleeper seats for longer stopovers. If there is a gripe it is that the toilets are ""no flushing of tissues"". I know that the whole of the airport waste disposal is based on this principal but I havn't experienced this since some 30 years ago I had a holiday in a Greek Taverna! The whole Thai First experience - aircraftcabin service ground service and the First Lounge makes Thai the only carrier to use in and out of its home base.",Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,no
Thai Airways,The Concourse C lounge is the least crowded offers showers and a sleeping space. The bathroom amenities are really nice. The food can be better and the staff always seem busy going in and out of the kitchen. The internet and computers seem to have problems. If you are a Thai business class passenger you can use the lounge spa and get a free 20-minute massage - this is the best part- but only if you are actually flying Thai business (or first) class.,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3.0,4,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,no
Thai Airways,I was on Air Canada flight to Vancouver and had a choice between this lounge and the Red Carpet lounge next door. As I have been to the Red Carpet lounge before I opted to stay in this lounge. The lounge was small but really airy. Food selection was ample and fantastic. WiFi was great.Staff very helpful and attentive. I was travelling with my niece though she was travelling with Cathay Pacific but the lady at the reception made sure that she got in after paying a minimal fee. Now that's customer service! Quite the contrary when I went to the Cathay Pacific lounge on Christmas day. I was holding a business class boarding pass and my nephews were travelling economy. They needed to take a shower and when I talked to the people at the reception they were not willing to let them in even after I offered to pay.,Hong Kong Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no

Turkish Airlines,"Friendly reception, clean, big windows, calm atmosphere. No clock or time visible, Not easy to find (mainly due to work in progress at the terminal).  Broken glasses offered. Lighting was on, while there was more than enough light from outside because of the sunny day. No shaded windows. The inside temperature was high, in combination with the lighting. High occupation, during busy times so even less comfort and food available. Grey interior, not welcoming, feels more static. Food is scarce.

Turkish Airlines,Massive with different areas ranging from a romantic setting in the middle next to a large Turkish Airlines globe to an elegant piano bar a garden setting in second floor and tea bar etc. There is even a golf course simulator downstairs. Food is delicious and staff extremely attentive and friendly. My negative feedback is that they do not have nearly enough English Spanish German newspapers.

Turkish Airlines,Excellent lounge although the toilets always seem to be busy. It must be the fantastic food and very good selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages available. I have read it gets very crowded but when I used the lounge - for 7 hours on the 7th of February - it was less crowded than for instance Thai Lounges in Bangkok Singapore Lounges in Singapore or Air NZ lounges in New Zealand. I won't stoop so low and comment on how much superior this lounge is to typical North American business class lounge: everyone who travels knows that.,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Turkish Airlines,Lounge in IST apparently won prizes which is beyond me - feels like a major cafeteria/canteen - it is huge and not to me liking. Absolutely crowded despite being so big and completely lacks all levels of personalized service feeling. Upon entering the lounge boarding pass beeped by a TK rep with zero eye contact. Food on offer very confusing and one has to go to several different places in the lounge to for instance get a breakfast plate. Eggs one place juice a second place and then coffee a third place etc. Highly time consuming and feels like a marathon for both customers and staff.,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,2.0,1,1,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Turkish Airlines,This is for the domestic CIP lounge in Izmir. This is a lovely clean lounge with great bathrooms and friendly staff. The design is homey yet modern. There is adequate amount of snacks but not extensive hot food selection. No alcohol only coffee tea and soft drinks.

Turkish Airlines,A massive airport to negotiate. Staff very unhelpful and rude. Once the lounge is found the staff at the desk and barriers are rude.

Spotlessly clean.,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,yes
Turkish Airlines,This is one of the best business lounges I have been to. Lounge is huge with all kinds of food and drink stations throughout each with many choices. Tea & Coffee stations Alcoholic Drink Stations Cold food and hot food stations and they are very good to excellent. Lounge personnel are helpful and friendly.

Turkish Airlines,With the exception of staff language skills this lounge is simply exceptional. Food and beverage choices are unbelievably wide.

Turkish Airlines,Unbelievably good. Pool table & library many bars glass enclosures with locks for luggage many chefs and self-service top-shelf liquor game room for the kids showers etc. The food was fantastic of course Turkish coffee and Turkish Delight and probably an acre in size.

Turkish Airlines,A very pleasant experience. I enjoy using Turkish Airlines - good fares and helpful staff but the airport can be cramped and crowded. As was the lounge until expanded recently. A joy to visit - you hope for a longer stay between flights! Good food variety of seating areas and airy. I can't wait to use again. Probably only downside is the number of toilets and washrooms which are often very busy.,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Turkish Airlines,The best business lounge I have had the pleasure of spending time in. Food excellent. Roaming masseurs were welcome. Showers spotless. Bag storage area neat. Beautiful design. Toilets immaculate. My only gripe was my stop over was eight hours and a suite could only be booked if staying 4-7 hours. I was offered the use of a hotel room in Istanbul but declined. Lounge was only really busy from 06.30-08.30 during my stay.,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Turkish Airlines,First time in the new lounge area and wow - what a difference! Divided on two floors so much space and not overcrowded any more. The food options are truly second to none with freshly prepared food counters in many parts of the lounge. Got to use a lounge bedroom (very comfortable) and enjoyed shower in 5-Star hotel standard bathroom. Big boy's Scalextric track also fun! At last it looks like Turkish Airlines have really turned a corner in progress and this is the best lounge I have visited. Pity that the rest of Istanbul airport is so poor.,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Turkish Airlines,Following the expansion of the THY lounge at Istanbul Ataturk it is no longer overcrowded.

Turkish Airlines,In theory the lounge is quite nice but at peak periods you should not even bother going to the lounge. It is normally full to overflowing staff will not offer any assistance to find seats etc. The washrooms and shower facilities are quite poor and badly maintained. Good snack and other foods if you can find anywhewre to sit. Staff service is good for the catering type staff but Turkish Airlines staff are rude and well below standard.,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,3.0,1,2,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,no
Turkish Airlines,The literature states that this place has a capacity for 331 people. There must be at least twice that many here. No seats no food no power sockets. This cannot be called 'business' as it is impossible to do any. All I wanted in my three hour stop over was to charge my laptop send some emails and have something to eat. Impossible. Never using Turkish again to fly on business travel.

Turkish Airlines,"I travel frequently from IST but typically don't use Turkish Airlines for business so this was my first time in the new lounge. I didn't use the showers nor many of the other amenities but the one's I tried to take advantage of didn't instil confidence. I wasn't impressed with the lounge: I thought they might be having an ""off"" day so I asked to speak to someone in charge. It took nearly a half an hour to find someone. the excuse for not having an available manager in the lounge was that it wasn't a busy time of the day despite it being 3:30 in the afternoon on a Friday and packed. It was far too busy and loud. If indeed the mornings are busier I would hate to see it. After sorting through the piles of newspapers that seemed to be tossed haphazardly on the tables - they don't use magazine racks - I found that there were no English newspapers in the lounge. According to the lounge manager they ""have them but they typically run out in the morning"". Knowing that the idea of having some more for the afternoon passengers hadn't occurred to her. Food quality seemed good but accessing catering was very chaotic. For example there are two chefs working in tandem; rather than create a staggered system where some food is constantly coming out of the oven the two of them prepare food together load the ovens together then stand around until they take everything out then start the process again. Of course by the time each batch is ready there is a hoard of people are lined up and instantly they run out until another batch is made. Lockers were an excellent touch and the library was nice though I think that it's more for show than actual use in that it is as exposed and equally noisy as everywhere else in the lounge. A lot of people seemed to be highly irritated with the service on the day I was there and although each one of us seemed to be complaining about smallish problems I got the overall sense that things were simply not up to standard.",Istanbul Ataturk Airport,3.0,2,5,3.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,no
Turkish Airlines,I was looking forward to visiting this lounge but my experience was bad. We arrived at 6am from a long Hong Kong flight and had about 90 minutes to rest before the next leg. The lounge was crowded and there were no seats! We wanted coffee and just to relax but there was no place to sit we wandered around for almost 20 minutes before finally grabbing an open seat. All the lockers were also full so nowhere to stash our carryon bags we had to lug them around the lounge too. And to make matters worse the showers were all full for an entire hour. We felt like we were at the Grand Bazaar pushing and shoving our way just to find a seat and a cup of coffee. In a word it was stressful not relaxing at all.,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,3.0,1,4,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,no
Turkish Airlines,From dedicated baggage screening luggage lock boxes baristas preparing a la carte coffee drinks Apple Computer Stations luxurious bathrooms well furnished and decorated lounges to cordial and helpful staff wife and I were thoroughly impressed with Business Class Lounge. Turkish Airways single Airport Club to serve every category of premium ticket holding passenger or frequent flyer may not be for those seeking exclusivity or tiered service areas yet it worked well for us. Accounting for quality and quantity of food when flying long-haul business class we found food selection and portions appropriate for a lay-over stay in lounge. We were also not expecting nor did we avail ourselves of a private sleeper rooms in Business Class Lounge. I disagree with reviewer stating that Turkish custom of allowing Police officers to eat/drink for free must be stop. I did not observe police coming in and drinking tea/coffee. People in their role as citizens or public or private policy role of any given country that treat those who provide service whether public service / infrastructure or service industry as second class citizens have much to learn from Turkish way if not Turkish Airways! I found it a pleasant surprise when observing Turkish hotel employees eating from breakfast buffet.,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Turkish Airlines,Lounge is expansive and nicely furnished with a lot of options for how to spend your time. It can get quite crowded though and while there are lots of drinks on offer the food is limited and more snack based. The reception staff had a smile which ticks that box and the rest seemed very pleasant though they were just picking up cups. Overall nice place to spend time though worth exploring it to find a quiet corner when busy.,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes

Turkish Airlines,"Pleasantly surprised when I visited after an absence of 10 months. Much bigger and nicer than the old lounge. Lots of food and drinks choices. Washrooms are nicer. I am not sure I like the ""minaret"" style. Too Arabic for my liking. Must point out the interesting acoustic trait the minarets have caused. If you start hearing random people speaking and there is no one around you don't worry you haven't lost the plot or turned schizophrenic. The minarets carry and bounce voices around much like the whispering gallery at St Paul's cathedral. I could hear some talking a good 40 meters away around a 90 degree bend. The Turkish custom of allowing Police officers to eat/drink for free must also stop. They kept on coming in and drinking tea/coffee. Didn't interact that much with the staff so can't really comment.",Istanbul Ataturk Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Turkish Airlines,The lounge is nicely redecorated and looks stylish. The coffee bar is amazing but other than that there is nothing more nice to say. Staff at the reception were rude unfriendly and unable to help with flight changes. There is also no fresh orange juice - though they specially announce it - the same thing onboard. It is not even juice just lemonade with part juice concentrate content. Dayrooms are unavailable as they give them out late at night for 6 hours and with 4am arrival all rooms were blocked. As well there are not enough showers - a waiting time of 60 minutes is not acceptable. Not thought through for an airline with mainly transfer pax. No high-quality amenities - bulk stuff in a push-bottle! Everything is meant good but not done well. Staff has a lot room for improvement!,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,no
Turkish Airlines,A great looking Lounge but third class service standards. I have not seen a lounge with such poorly trained staff. The lady handling Concierge desk was the most unpleasant one.

Turkish Airlines,The lounge has just reopened after a 3 month renovation. The design is very modern with a circular theme. There are numerous drink stations and food bars with most delicious Turkish food provided by Do&Co. Plenty of space food drinks barista service multiple TV entertainment Pool table and a library. The shower suites and toilet facilities are very stylish with marble tiling wood paneling and mirrored walls. High quality Etro toiletries provided in the showers along with towels slippers and bathrobe. There are only 8 iMacs for guests which use an odd keyboard with many standard keys replaced with non-standard keys. No @ symbol on the keyboard which made them almost impossible to use. The only downside is the that the staff are still coming to terms with the new facilities and on the whole they all need to learn to smile and relax a bit instead of grunting.,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,no

Turkish Airlines,I used the Turkish Lounge at IST as a J pax with another Star Alliance carrier. The lay out was airy and the decor was mainly Ottoman-style. There were shower facilities (again Ottoman- style with marble sinks etc). Food choices were adequate for mid afternoon with the usual selection of hot & cold snacks. There were a few different areas (large comfy sofas quiet area computers etc).,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,4.0,4,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Turkish Airlines,Good choice of facilities. Business services prayer room refreshments etc. Range of seating available - in seperate lounges for meals on sofas in open plan area etc.. and plenty of space for discreet discussions if required. Decoration quite impressive. Intrusive noise though from 4 tvs on different channels plus some noise from other areas of airport. Nice choice of drinks and snacks available and constant cleaning from staff kept the whole area very neat and presentable. As a non- drinker can not comment on size of a glass offered as on other reviews but range of drinks was quite broad if wanted. Soft drinks include teas coffees orange juice waters etc. Staff I found to be excellent not at all rude or dismissive and very welcoming. Also there was no pervasive cigarette smoke evident - very welcome to a non-smoker in Turkey. Location of Lounge is at one end of the airport and can be quite a few minutes to walk to gates but shops and other services close to Lounge so no need to walk unnecessarily far. A good and comfortable service.,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no

Turkish Airlines,The lounge is very specious and has an interesting decoration. I have been at all peak times there and there was always enough space to sit and relax. There are showers available (some review say it has not) - to use it you should contact the front desk staff for amenities and staff was mostly friendly. The choice of alcoholic drinks could be increased though and size of glasses as well. A slient room for taking a nap is missing though.,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,4.0,5,5,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no
Turkish Airlines,"The ""new"" lounge is located at the exact opposite end of the airport. It is quite a hike there but most flights to Asia and the US depart from there so I guess it is ok. It is quite unique : huge sofas and armchairs impressive chandeliers (like in a palace) and soft carpets. At peak times seating is very limited and I saw people leave the lounge because of not enough seating. There is an open bar with a wide selection of drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic) - albeit glasses are very small - and some snacks (puff pastry and sandwiches). There are no showers which is quite a disappointment after a long flight. Bathrooms could be cleaner. There is a business center with free internet access and there are of course muslim prayer rooms.

In particular, Greek yoghurt was offered with a huge bowl of fresh strawberries and blueberries. If I had had ample time, I could have fashioned a tasty breakfast. The club is larger than I expected, and even at 7:30 AM, there was ample and comfortable seating. The large windows look out onto a busy tarmac, so there were interesting views.

United Airlines,"Flew United Business for the first time and off to a bad start straightaway by not being admitted to the club lounge. Apparently you have to be a 'club' registered customer. Poor! I have bought a

United Airlines,I visited this lounge on 23 May 2015 as ANA business class flyer on my way to Tokyo. It is by far the best United lounge I have visited amazing bar with incredible selection. Very good food quality and variety. Plenty of space to sit good internet connection. Miles ahead of United Airlines lounges in NY or LA.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
United Airlines,United charges $50 for lounge access to First Class travelers on domestic flights. I cannot believe it especially when your flight is delayed due to crew not available. Poor customer service overall not worth the price of the ticket.,Austin Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,"Worst lounge I've ever experienced. Old and worn out crowded no adequate number of seats service nonexistent and offered nothing but cheap snacks. Furthermore most supplies were always empty or ""will be"" be replenished. No hot food or proper cold food except bar snacks in plastic disposable cups. Not all beverages are complementary - $12 for a decent drink - and grumpy staff expects tips for serving free beer! Awful overcrowded no accommodations no service for handicapped people.The food selection is unhealthy and at best more like an unhealthy snack bar. The same goes for the bar. The wine is bad and the beer selection is main stream and boring. There's no sense for details. Last and most important the staff seems as worn out as the lounge. No smiles no pride. Just hanging in there. Like they know the company they work for is barely making it.",Newark Airport,2.0,1,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,Had a three hour delay for a United flight leaving Newark so I purchased a Red Carpet one day access for $50. From the moment I entered the red carpet lounge I found the entire staff unwelcoming never smile surly and down right unpleasant. I have never been in a lounge with an entire staff that was so unhappy. I was glad to get a cubicle seat to do some work but each encounter with the staff from check in to drink service to food service was very bad. I am surprised United would allow such an important lounge to be run so poorly. My only recommendation would be for a complete staff overall from the lounge manager to the bartenders.,Newark Airport,2.0,2,3,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,I was horrified by the service the food availability and environment of the lounge itself. In case all United Clubs are like this they do not deserve the tag lounge. Call them United airport area. It seemed to me better to wait outside of the lounge than inside. Take example from Etihad and Emirates or Star Alliance partner lounges as Air Canada Turkish Airways or Lufthansa. I wonder why Star Alliance does not have a global lounge standard.,Newark Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

United Airlines,"Worst lounge I've ever experienced. Service non existent and offered nothing but cheap snacks. Furthermore most supplies were always empty or ""gunna"" be replenished. Also discover that despite a first class ticket I was not allowed access unless I paid $50 US! To make it really bad. I decided that I needed a shower after a trip from Sydney - after I paid told that there was no shower - can you believe it.",Los Angeles Lax Airport,2.0,2,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,Awful lounge. No food no shower and over crowded - probably due to a large number of Star Alliance flyers and lack of any other Star Alliance lounge. Every time I go to that SFO UA lounge for banana and yogurts only - never stay for over 10 min.,San Francisco Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,This may be a relatively new lounge but by international First Class standards it is poor. Staff on front desks do nothing more than check your boarding pass invite - no welcome no dialogue and United needs to get some serious training - 2 star service at best. Same stewed hot food laid out on hotplate during my visit (6pm) - very unappetising and a bit like I remember UA onboard food to be. I see some other reviewers here raving about the new Business Class lounge - either that is truly different to the First Class lounge or some of them need to visit airline lounges around Asia to find out what good quality is all about. Penny-pinching clearly has a part to play but the sad thing is that I believe United set their targets at such a low level that most outside the USA are astounded how poor they are.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,4,4,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,Just snacks and basic beverages to offer. Some complimentary alcoholic drinks are available but must be ordered at the bar. There is Premium beverages - whatever it means - to purchase at the bar. Wifi works quite well.,San Francisco Airport,2.0,2,3,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,United's Star Alliance Gold lounges in the US are disappointing compared to their new one at LHR T2. No hot food or proper cold food except bar snacks in plastic disposable cups. Not all beverages are complementary and grumpy staff expect tips for serving free beer! Perhaps United should stop offering paid access to these lounges (through credit card memberships etc.) and just raise their standards.,Newark Airport,3.0,4,4,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,Personnel is present to check eligibility clearly not motivated to be of help. The advantage of being in this lounge basically consist of waiting in a confortable leather imitation sofa. If you want a shorter wait stay outside. WIFI connection seems faster outside. (must be my computer but it works outside). No luggage lockers available (because of safety? but I have been checked twice). No showers available. Only snacks available no useful food. Beer has to be paid unless it is one of two watery bud-light type. Lounge was very busy. Almost more confortable outside. How do you attract people to come into the lounge? Observing what the competition does would be useful.,San Francisco Airport,2.0,1,2,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,no
United Airlines,Lounge was fine. Took a shower watched TV in a large room used our PC and had some basic snacks for free. One can get food booze etc. in the bar area (basic wine and beer free others have to be paid for). Lounge was crowded so finding seats wasn't easy.,Newark Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,yes
United Airlines,Awful overcrowded it was impossible to find a seat. The restrooms were filthy I could not use them. I had to call the shower attendant and ask him to have the restrooms cleaned.,Sao Paulo Guarulhos Airport,2.0,2,1,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,So small we couldn't find a seat food was practically non-existent - just some cookies and cheese and crackers.

United Airlines,This is United Flagship Lounge in Terminal 2 at LHR Heathrow Airport. It's very spacious and modern white marble leather seating (open or more secluded).I was there for a late 10pm flight back to New York and there was so much food choice. What a shame that United didn't initiate this in the USA.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
United Airlines,Absolutely sub-standard. No food no accessible refreshments like water soda or juice. WiFi not working and staff is clueless. They even try to charge you for a glass of wine or beer.,Newark Airport,2.0,1,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,Terrible management. I asked for shower and was told that in addition to shower I was entitled to 15 min of spa treatment with Business Class ticket. I was not looking for spa and just went for shower. They have 8 rooms and one had a wet towel and no soap. The do not provide shampoo. Finally I found a room with a folder towel. I hope it was clean!! I will not shower there in future. I think considering a country like India where anything can happen I should have ask for a clean towel and shampoo at the beginning (which is the norm in a shower facility). The two ladies manning the facility did not speak much English. After shower I went to the dining section. Menu selection was good - but the tables were dirty. For shower I gave one * - could not find a way to put zero.,Mumbai Airport,2.0,3,1,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,no
United Airlines,Stop-Over-Experience on the way from Hawaii to Frankfurt. We had a stop for nearly 9hrs originally planned to be spent in downtown SFO. But we arrived sick with a flu so we needed to have a retreat at the business-Lounge. SFO Airport got a complete update even so the business-club-Lounge of United. But the furnishing is pretty pour new but cold and minimized to uncomfortable chairs and small tables. The breakfast buffet doesn't deserve this name pretty small and not rich. No deck chairs have been provided no showers or relaxing-room. Lots of guests tried to sleep on uncomfortable lounge chairs somebody need to think about the real needs of their guests. The best thing of this Lounge was the view. Only to recommend for a short stop not more.,San Francisco Airport,2.0,1,4,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,Of all the United Airlines lounges that I have been to this lounge has to be the best. In this lounge you don't need a bartender to get a beer pour a glass of wine or make a drink; you can do it yourself. If you look hard enough you will find the ice creme. Salads are always available along with a few light meals. The showers are wonderful the internet works great and the employees are the best. The seats have a great view of the terminal and there are plenty of places to charge your electrical devices. My only complaint is that I only have a one hour layover in Hong Kong.,Hong Kong Airport,1.0,1,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,yes
United Airlines,Not the worst UA lounge but on a par with most things United — pretty dreadful. No showers before the long haul to and across Asia? Unheard of! No food to speak of. Clean enough but very crowded.,Honolulu Airport,2.0,2,4,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,no
United Airlines,"This is a low even for United. Buried in the basement of the International Terminal the United Club in Melbourne is embarrassing on a whole new level. From the sad offerings of ""hot"" food to the rarely- looked-after beverage station this lounge disappoints. The walls a soft padded dingy grey relic from the early '90s only serve to bring the mood of the lounge down to a level of murky depression. The worst part of this lounge however is the pathetic ""WiFi service"" that is only provided by Melbourne Airport. Free WiFi from the airport is never good and in the bowels of Tullamarine's transport hub it degrades to ""nearly unusable."" All of this would be fine if not for the lack of chairs. For an international lounge that serves many major continents there are between 25 and 30 seats in the entire lounge. Most of the seats face another so it is more uncomfortable to take an empty seat thereby reducing the most often usable seats by half. Dishes running out food running out and messes left unattended are par for the course at the United Club in MEL. This is by far the worst United Club I have ever been to and Ive been to ORD C LAX T3 Newark and some of the other dregs of the Lounge world. United has an extensive history of disappointing its frequent travellers but after staying here I am looking into moving my miles to Air New Zealand or Singapore or another Start Alliance partner as a preferred carrier.",Melbourne Airport,2.0,1,2,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,Dreadful poor service overcrowded no food apart from stale bagels. Avoid this airline if you want to travel in comfort.,Las Vegas Airport,1.0,1,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Us Airways,The Club looks spacious but served very very simple Continental breakfast at a small corner. If you don't eat bagels or instant oatmeal there will be nothing for you to eat. No snacks for the breakfast. I was looking for helps. A waitress sat by the bar without uniform looked at me as if she was one of the customers. I didn't know that she was a working staff until she started to take trashes away from tables. Apparently she was not professionally trained. The receptionist did offer great helps proactively to arrange disability assistance.,Unknown,2.0,3,2,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,This place is a joke. Water coffee and tea? beer isn't free? no food selection? what is the point of this place anyway? If you are paying money to go into united club at LAX don't waste your mind. Save $50 and buy a steak at one of the steakhouse place in the airport.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,Compared to their dismal offerings in Chicago this is different for United. On my visit it was busy but not overcrowded the food was good and the bar service excellent. The full breakfast buffet and lunch selections were hot and good quality I was impressed! Some more comfy/lounge-style seats would be the only real improvement I could suggest.,London Heathrow Airport,4.0,4,4,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Us Airways,Had a short one hour layover in Charlotte and decided to try out the Admirals Club. Luckily as a BA Silver member I have free access to US domestic lounges regardless of my itinerary. Lounge was a reasonable size with plenty of chairs. The selection of beverages and food however was pretty pathetic. Just yoghurt bagels and coffee - nothing else. I certainly wouldn't bother paying for the privilege to use it but it served its purpose for my short layover since I had time to grab a coffee and a couple of bagels.,Charlotte Airport,3.0,4,5,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
Us Airways,If you ever consider to pay for club membership this should keep you from doing it. Old and worn out seats some as shabby as their airliners' seats. Unfriendly staff that tries to avoid work at all cost: my flight was delayed and I asked them to let me know when boarding would begin. Answer: We can't do that you have to go to the gate to find out. Food: in the mornings bagels muffins yogurt like a typical middle class hotel buffet. Decent bar with a lackluster bartender (see above about avoiding work). Pretty small place so it can get crowded. WiFi is the free wifi available all over the airport. And remember even if you fly first class as I do you have to be a club member or pay $ 29/50 for a day pass unless you fly intercontinental. This money is much better spent in one of the airport restaurants.,Phoenix Airport,3.0,3,2,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,no
Us Airways,The US Airways lounge at Phoenix Airport unfortunately is no different from much of the companies other lounges. Old and worn out. The food selection is unhealthy and poor. The interior is worn old and cramped. Worst of all the staff seem to be as worn out and unattending as the decor and the food. They walk around looking very busy no smiles more like robots. Maybe the staff is told by the company to show no positive emotions so clients don't ask any questions. The only comment I got was how busy the previous day had been. It's pretentious and so not up to date.,Phoenix Airport,2.0,1,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,Travelled with family from New Delhi (DEL) to Des Moines (DSM) via Newark (EWR). In New Delhi they put us up in the Singapore Airlines lounge which is first class. At EWR their Business Class lounge is awful. Crowded no adequate number of seats. No food except crackers some fruits coffee and tea. Not even fruit juice or soft drinks. Surprisingly I had access to their very basic shower facility and they have free internet connectivity. The European airlines maintain better lounge facilities. However I was more surprised at DSM. DSM is a relatively large airport but United flies only a small plane (39 seater) there from EWR once a day and they have no business class lounge facility at DSM! And they are not ashamed of it. I somehow felt that after the 9/11 incident in 2001 the American airlines especially United got an opportunity to go no frills and they give an impression that they are all running on no profit basis. My experience with the United Club was simply disappointing.,Newark Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,United airlines has the most bare bones lounges in the industry. There is practically no food just crackers and soda. And this lounge was no exception. I am not sure why anyone wants to bother to get in these lounges. I guess some people like it just for feeling exclusive.,Chicago O'Hare Airport,2.0,3,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,no
Us Airways,The leather seats were very uncomfortable. Red wine was tasted by most and either left or they went back and paid for an upgrade. Food not so great. Bartender could not open the wine bottle. I had to do it for her. While that is not a big deal for me I did rank the staff low only because she had not been trained at all.,Phoenix Airport,3.0,1,4,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,no
Us Airways,This club is comfortable and flexible as you have the choice of sitting in the quiet area or the louder tv area. I like the two story window looking at the planes/weather etc. House wines and beer are no charge. Food options are limited. The soup is good but NEVER changes. The staff are courteous and as mentioned do a good job cleaning the whole complex. The Internet works well. It provides clean rest rooms and a place to get some work done.,Charlotte Airport,4.0,4,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Us Airways,Although this lounge wasn't crowded for my early morning departure as Club members with USAir United and Air Canada international Business Class and international Star Gold economy passengers can access this lounge it does get crowds at times. This lounge is very comfortable as you have the choice of sitting in darker areas or in the light of the panoramic two story window looking at the Tarmac. There is also a large and separate quiet room for relaxing. Drink options are great as there are self serve options as well as a separate bar room. That being said food options aren't the best as there are just apples and chips most of the day. I do give this category 3 stars however as I have heard that in the evenings when the long haul departures are they offer more food that could be a full meal. The staff are very kind and courteous and do a good job cleaning the whole complex. The Internet works very well also. Overall I definitely would not purchase a $50 day pass to experience this lounge or even buy it for $29 when I booked my flight but if I fit into the criteria I described above it is better than waiting at the gate.,Charlotte Airport,4.0,5,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
United Airlines,Used this lounge when flying ANA to Tokyo. Had expected some good things from what is a new lounge and supposedly the flagship level of United Airlines but disappointed. No showers in First class section and you have to queue up to use Business class area if you want this amenity. Food choices at 6pm very limited to just 3 sad looking dishes under a heated light and a small choice of cheeses and cold items. Waiting staff are polite and quite attentive in contrast to quite miserable front desk reception staff. Seating choices all somewhat bland and one gets the feeling that there was little in the way of creative design used for this lounge. truly disappointing for a 2014 First Class facility.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,3,4,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,I was very disappointed to discover that Singapore Airlines Lounge at the new Terminal 2 was not open. We were directed to use the United Airlines Lounge. Unfortunately due to the busy flight schedules of various airlines who were using the United Airlines Lounge it was very crowded and difficult to get a seat not with the internet facilities. There was not a lot of food available and we were disappointed with the quality of the food.,London Heathrow Airport,3.0,2,3,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,Surprised to read the recent reviews of the O'Hare lounge(s). Visited 2 on my last trip through (on a First Class tix) and was not impressed. This is their hub location expected top notch and it was disappointing. Cheese & crackers & fruit and drinks (free back then) from surly bartenders who made it quite clear they expected tips. Yah right. Fortunately I had not yet confirmed another 1st booking via ORD (on points as part of Star Alliance) and will not do so now. I'll do anything to route through Star airlines to enjoy the benefits of Air Canada or Lufthansa lounges. Makes United look like a donut shop.,Chicago O'Hare Airport,2.0,2,3,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,no
Us Airways,Large lounge. Often crowded in the main area but the quiet room was nearly empty. Very limited selection of snacks but we did get vouchers for a free premium drink at the bar (generic drinks were free). Unlike some United Clubs and Delta Sky Clubs no showers at US Airways clubs. Would have been nice after an overnight flight. Decent Wi-Fi.,Charlotte Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Us Airways,Small club with no windows but it was clean and relaxing. Decent but small selection of snacks. We were flying first class to connect to an international business class flight out of Charlotte and while the US Airways agent at the check-in desk said we probably wouldn't be allowed in the club there was no problem (because of the same-day connection to international business class).,Los Angeles Lax Airport,4.0,4,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
United Airlines,A private lounge located near the synagogue in the routanda. Smaller than the two lounges of Dan in concourses B and C but United Airlines and British Airways are allowed to enter. Supposed to be more exquisite. Lounge not crowded in the evening in busy August. Where Dan Lounge itself seemed to be packed as it is just before 4-5 flights depart to the US. Basic soft drinks juices and wine selection. Almost no refreshments. A disgrace. After visiting IST lounge of Turkish Airlines this pales in comparison.,Tel Aviv Airport,2.0,2,4,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,A disgrace a dingy lounge with not a lot of light located on top of concurse B in Ohare. Very basic breakfast offerings. If you want soft drinks service at the bar slow and requires a wait. Continental breakfast offerings. Delta club is much better.

Us Airways,There is no longer a dedicated lounge for Envoy Class - it is just the regular Club with one free drink ticket for which I got an undrinkable bloody mary. Only chips and salsa and some cookies as the food offering. Anything more substantial has to be paid for. Hardly Business Class standard especially when compared with the excellent BA lounge in this airport.,Philadelphia Airport,3.0,4,4,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no

Us Airways,The club is very pleasant and what makes it worthwhile is a large quiet room with a sign stating no cell phones or loud conversations. It was actually quiet. A man was talking loudly on his phone and a staff member very professionally but very firmly asked him to go to the main lounge area as he was disturbing people in the quiet room. This room is a welcome relief from cell phones loud conversations etc. that can be jarring especially after a long international flight.,Charlotte Airport,3.0,4,4,3.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,yes
United Airlines,The worst lounge and service  they might as well not bother offering the lounge. Food is stale old sandwiches  crackers and cheese. Flight delayed from 10pm till 11.30pm  no hot food offered told to go to restaurant next door. Staff unconcerned and no concept of first class service.

United Airlines,"Comfortable lounge with an excellent selection of hot and cold dishes and a very well-appointed clean shower room.

United Airlines,Unbelievably bad even for the consistently bad quality of United lounges. LAX is probably United Airlines busiest international hub and yet the lounge has no showers! People flying from Asia and continuing to South America (as I was) will be shocked and infuriated at the lack of a single shower stall.

Us Airways,Travelling First Class Boston to Philadelphia on entering lounge advised that US Airways did not have a first class lounge in Boston and that this lounge was a pay lounge was advised that the lounge did not serve alcohol. The lounge had tea coffee and water if you required a soft drink you had to find someone to get it for you snack selection very limited and poor. In short do not pay to use this lounge.,Boston Logan Airport,3.0,3,4,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,no
Us Airways,Friendly staff at reception desk. Pleasant relaxing atmosphere though unable to see out of windows because of louvres. Very poor selection of magazines - not even their own inflight magazine. Simple snacks but plenty of snacks and beverages.,Phoenix Airport,4.0,4,4,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no
United Airlines,This miserable excuse for a business class lounge gets worse every time I use it. The food is terrible. The furniture old and battered. The staff sullen and lazy. Then to top it off the lounge is filthy and the bathrooms worse. The only virtue is that the wifi is merely mediocre. There is a view of the runway. Good thing because gazing anywhere else gives one the creepy crawlies. We are forced into this awful lounge prior to boarding international star alliance flights (other carriers than United thank god). But if this lounge is any indication of what it is like on board their planes avoid at all costs (and I do).,San Francisco Airport,2.0,2,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no

When I went back for a second drink ready to pay for a bottled beer I found that draft beer was free (okay it was just Bud and Bud Light). Our US Airways flight's departure time was moved back from 1015pm to 11pm but before it was 10 pm there were announcements that the club was closing right at 10.

United Airlines,"We were booked into a United BusinessFirst cabin so we were given access to the Alitalia lounge located in the lower level (read as basement) of the terminal. The check in desk upon entering is staffed by Alitalia employees who were fairly friendly. Since it was early (7:30 a.m.) we didn't expect too much. We weren't disappointed. The lounge is very dated with a bland color scheme - white and orange. There was a service station manned by a very unhappy looking gent who despite his sour demeanor provided efficient - albeit robotic - service. Coffee (American) was available but the cup is one that is normally used for cappuccino so not very large. Cappuccinos and espressos are available on request. The ""food"" consisted of cold cereals sweet croissants and bread/butter with jam. Yogurts were also available but without spoons. Since it was so early we weren't interested in cocktails but the 'bar"" consisted of bottles of mostly empty liquor save for the almost full bottle of sweet vermouth. Don't plan on having a drink in this lounge - there won't be anything available. Our flight was announced and we made our way to the gate. This ""lounge"" was really sad.

Only downside was the bartender he definitely needed coaching on how to work with people. Not a people person at all.,Philadelphia Airport,4.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Us Airways,The membership is not particularly cheap and it offers less all the time. Selection of free coffees has been cut back and on this occasion the $12 salad was inedible (old) so was exchanged for a barely edible sandwich. Their food for purchase used to be good but no longer the case. Alcoholic drinks overpriced considering you already paid for the membership and staff friendly and helpful only when they feel like it. Restrooms often dirty.,Philadelphia Airport,2.0,4,3,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,Surely this is the worst of all lounges I know in last 5 years. The Buffett is horrendous and alcoolic drink you pay!. Wi Fi working slowing very slowing. The furniture poor. This room dont have any workstation is ridiculous! A mediocre service. If you have any other option run away from this.,Chicago O'Hare Airport,2.0,2,3,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,United Club in Narita is huge and when it gets crowded the wi-fi is overloaded and stops working. There is hardly any food and certainly no hot food nor food of quality. The UA managers should walk 50 yards to the ANA lounge and see what they serve in there. It's like going from a McDonald's to a Michelin starred restaurant. BTW the ANA wi-fi seems to work well all the time.,Tokyo Narita Airport,1.0,2,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,Surely this is the worst of all lounges I know in GRU. Buffet is horrendous even in flavor. Wi Fi not working even requesting employees. The furniture is extremely old outdated. The room is crowded all the time with passengers standing. This is ridiculous. A mediocre service disrespectful even with First Class passengers.,Sao Paulo Guarulhos Airport,1.0,1,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,no
Us Airways,Large lounge and convenient. Chips and snack mix left out that is pretty much it. Bar area has drinks for sale good selection of flavored coffees available for free. Lounge is impressive when entering then you notice that almost all seating is tattered and in need of repair. Staff is nice- though other lounge on Concourse B is more intimate with great staff. Noticed that lounge also has wrapped cheese crackers and other items. Someone continuously circled cleaning the space as well.,Charlotte Airport,3.0,4,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,no
Us Airways,This was the worst and most low-budget lounge that I've ever been to as a business class passenger! Upon arrival at the front desk you are asked if you would like to use the cocktail-bar. The lounge is huge. Plenty of seats and these are quite comfortable (the only good point about this lounge). you get free coffee tea tab water with loads of ice from a pitcher and free apples as well as some this unidentifiable mixture of small crackers pretzels etc. Yuk! Soft drinks or juices: Forget it! That's what you need your cocktail-bar voucher for. You have the choice of 1 (yes: one) free alcoholic drink soft drink or juice. If you want more grab your wallet and pay big time: A beer will cost you 8 bucks! A very limited choice of magazines (no newspapers!). If you have time in Charlotte International don't go to the US Airways Club and rather have a seat in one of the rocking chairs or have a snack in the excellent food court. It is better and cheaper!,Charlotte Airport,1.0,3,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Us Airways,"US Airways actually has 3 lounges at PHX as this is a hub. There are 2 on the second floor (Low-A gates and Low-B gates) and one on the concourse level (High-A gates). The High-A lounge is the newest but also the nicest - with a modern hi-end decor. Unfortunately at times it gets very crowded and you may have trouble finding a seat. All 3 lounges offer the same amenities - coffee tea soft drinks free of charge alcoholic beverages are for purchase only. There is a time appropriate range of snacks - pastries and fruit in the morning; cheese crackers chips and cookies at and after lunch hour. The ""fresh baked"" cookies are usually quite good. In the Low-A and Low-B lounges there are separate TV lounges. All 3 also have business centers and conference rooms available. All also have good views of the tarmac/gate areas. There is free wireless internet available via a monthly changing password. Staff here is generally senior and quite helpful. They can be great help in securing first class upgrades at the last minute - and will always offer to call gate agents to check on individual flight status.",Phoenix Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no
United Airlines,Surely this is the worst of all lounges I know in last 5 years. The Buffet is horrendous and for alcoholic drinks you pay!. WiFi working slow very slow. The furniture poor.

United Airlines,"We were booked into a United BusinessFirst cabin so we were given access to the Alitalia lounge located in the lower level (read as basement) of the terminal. The check in desk upon entering is staffed by Alitalia employees who were fairly friendly. Since it was early (7:30 a.m.) we didn't expect too much. We weren't disappointed. The lounge is very dated with a bland color scheme - white and orange. There was a service station manned by a very unhappy looking gent who despite his sour demeanor provided efficient - albeit robotic - service. Coffee (American) was available but the cup is one that is normally used for cappuccino so not very large. Cappuccinos and espressos are available on request. The ""food"" consisted of cold cereals sweet croissants and bread/butter with jam. Yogurts were also available but without spoons. Since it was so early we weren't interested in cocktails but the 'bar"" consisted of bottles of mostly empty liquor save for the almost full bottle of sweet vermouth. Don't plan on having a drink in this lounge - there won't be anything available. Our flight was announced and we made our way to the gate. This ""lounge"" was really sad. United should be ashamed that this is what they offer their ""premium"" passengers.",Rome Fiumicino Airport,2.0,3,3,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,no
Us Airways,They only serve pretzels and some sort of vegetarian nut mix. Otherwise you can have a coffee or hot chocolate from the vending machine. Drinks costs five dollars and no free internet not even any desk top computer stations.,Boston Logan Airport,2.0,3,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,The staff were very vague since this was the 1st time I had visited a United Lounge so I had to ask what facilities there were to use what was complementary etc... the check in hostess was not friendly or helpful at all. It was dirty every table had empty cups & rubbish on them. I would not make a special effort to find one again especially in the airport the regular vendors at the airport were better serviced than the Members Lounges.,Washington Dulles Airport,2.0,3,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,There are lounges in both Terminals 6 and 7. I went to the one in Terminal 7. Large comfortable airy. I was there in late morning. There were still some breakfast-type selections though very very few and mainly in the sweet treat variety. At least there were a few juices and a very wide array of coffee drinks from machines. Wi-Fi reception was good.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,3.0,4,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes

United Airlines,United's best lounge by far. A ride up to a totally different class of service. The area was spacious comfortable and tasteful. A great selections of drinks was accompanied by a variety of Japan and Western snacks including sushi and small sandwiches. It does not compare to the hot meals and luxury of some Asian first class lounges but it shows what United can do when they made the effort.,Tokyo Narita Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
United Airlines,I have been a member of the United Club for several years now. The only reason I will continue to be a member is the lower cost I can become a member through my husbands credit card. The lounge is basic and has now as of a few months ago started charging for their drinks. They still charge the same price for the annual fee yet no more free drinks. I am also continuing my annual membership since I do travel a lot and use the other star alliance clubs which are far superior to the United Lounges. They are definitely nothing special don't waste your money.,Unknown,2.0,3,3,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,It is a nice place to sit (compared to the rest of O'Hare) but there is nothing to recommend it. Lounge is boring and uninspired. Food is cheap no thought in the selection high in carbs and sugar low in taste. Like the rest of the lounge not designed to please anyone but will not offend either. United agents who can help with reservations and changes.,Chicago O'Hare Airport,3.0,2,4,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no
United Airlines,The United Lounge is old and worn out. The food selection is unhealthy and at best more like an unhealthy snack bar. The same goes for the bar. The wine is bad and the beer selection is main stream and boring. There's no sense for details. Last and most important the staff seem as worn out as the lounge. No smiles no pride. Just hanging in there. Like they know the company they work for is barely making it.,Newark Airport,2.0,3,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,The new United Club at Sea-Tac is fantastic! Great location refurbished look and feel and great staff. Great place to get out of the hustle and bustle of the airport. Standard UA Club fare but the refreshed feel of the place and the attentive staff makes it great. Good people watching from above too. If you're in SEA be sure to hit this one.,Unknown,5.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
United Airlines,Disgraceful. Food consisted of carrots and cheese and biscuits in plastic packs. Crowded you have to pay for drinks. If this is how United treat their customers they've lost my custom.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,2.0,3,2,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,Nice little getaway from the hustle and bustle of ATL. Emphasis on the little but then again not too many UA operations ex ATL. Long and fairly narrow made it harder to hideaway somewhere although there are a few somewhat private cubicle work areas. Only one bathroom. Friendly and helpful staff. Nice views of tarmac. Minimal snacks - carrots crackers/cheese yogurt raisins. Not too noisy (the ubiquitous tv was up in a far corner) nice views. Downside: hard to hide away and take a nap.,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,2.0,2,4,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,no
United Airlines,I'm not sure why this is a lounge. Overcrowded drinks to be paid for at excessive prices and just a few snack items. Worse than sitting in the airport. Enough for me not to choose United Airlines again.,Washington Dulles Airport,2.0,2,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,I was flying Chicago - Orange County this morning booked into first class and when I bought the ticket I naturally assumed it includes entry to the United Club lounge at O'hare. Apparently not. I was denied entry and told that first class passengers travelling domestically are not given access to their lounges. I have travelled first class many times with a variety of airlines and have never been denied entry to a lounge when holding a first class ticket. But I guess United is different. At least I hope this will be helpful to anyone else who naively makes the same assumption.,Chicago O'Hare Airport,3.4,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,I have flown on United for several years now (in excess of 2M miles) and was a 1K for most of that time. This year I will not renew my lounge membership. Even post-merger the lounges are not well maintained people working the desk in larger airports are not consistently friendly or engaging and with the charging of alcohol that use to be included in membership (don't call it complimentary) it is just not worth it. A few weeks ago I flew Global-First to Sydney and was looking forward to the “First Class” lounge. Reception personnel more interested in chatting amongst themselves and no one in the actual club area to help. The food in this SFO “exclusive” first class lounge had the opportunity to be exceptional but most of the serving dishes were empty. When travelling I almost always look for the alternative carriers’ lounge for a better experience. Letters to United go unanswered.,Unknown,2.0,3,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,I traveled on United frequently and am always passing through the United Club Lounge at Narita. What is nice is that it is large has showers and a nice view of the runway. But if you want to work there on the Internet be aware that the Internet speed is awful. It's so bad that if you are Gold you should just go to the ANA Club by gate 42 (which is where I am writing from now). And the food is actually better.,Tokyo Narita Airport,3.0,4,4,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,no
United Airlines,"From the outside of the Jakarta Airport one would think otherwise when it comes to the First/Business Class Lounge but the one in Jakarta Airport is a surprise. Not very large but comfortable seats free Wi Fi with the ""code"" on a little slip of paper on the tables that could be mistaken for a scrap of paper! But this lounge has food like spaghetti the other night assorted fruits drinks and a nice espresso machine that does not require an engineering degree to operate. Simple atmosphere but a nice change and certainly nicer than the UA Lounge in Narita which is sad and really is a major disappointment with snacks and drinks. But for those who drink NRT must be like falling off their booze wagons.",Jakarta Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
United Airlines,"Tokyo Narita Lounge for Star Alliance Business Class is the pits. It is spacious and lots of nice chairs and is natural lit from its many windows but that is where the comfort level ends. While there are many nice chairs to sit in there are precious few power outlets and they are all US ""flat blade"" type of outlet not the rounded Euro plugs that are used in Asia too. Wi fi is the worst ever in a lounge I have seen. But the worst part of this lounge and I use the word sparingly is the awful food selection. Crackers shortbread cookies trail mix potato chips etc. Pretty poor selection. Now if I were a drinker which I am not I would be happy here. In the two hours I spent at the lounge at NRT the guy across from me had 4 glasses of red wine and at least 3 beers and countless trips to the grab the trail mix by the boatload. It is a shame the lounge is not food friendly because in comfort it has a lot of them beat.",Tokyo Narita Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,yes
United Airlines,Got in for a brief visit using two passes I got through my UA Explorer credit card. We were flying American and it was a longer than expected trip to the lounge. The lounge itself was fine and clean though smaller and overall more basic than I'd experienced with other United lounges. Basic snacks and hot beverages at self-service stations. It was early enough in the day that we didn't take advantage of the bar. Smallish rest rooms. Not a bad place to pass some time but not one of the better UA lounges I've seen.,Seattle Airport,2.0,4,3,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,yes

United Airlines,To be honest - the United Club lounge in San Francisco International is one big joke! Very old and worn-out furnishing and the food (or what one should call it) is just as bad as it can get (crackers lousy cheese and carrots packed in plastic bags). But worst of all - obviously United do not trust their customers so if you want anything with alcohol - you have to go all the way to the other end to a bar - just to realize that if you want more than a flat beer - you have to pay for it! You are better of with a visit to Starbucks. And to all of those airlines (Lufthansa SAS etc) that uses the Club Lounge as part of the Star Alliance - hurry up establishing your own lounge - your customers are used to MUCH better service than what United can do.,San Francisco Airport,2.0,2,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,I flew business class. I assumed that during my layover in Denver I can simply wait in business class lounge as I am used to. Surprisingly unless you are traveling internationally you have no access to the lounge. Not even with AMEX card. Finally I was able to go there for a fee of $50 so I did. Carrots and packed terrible crackers. Nothing else. Really? Terrible. Whoever runs the lounge should look up any European lounge. International travelers in business class avoid Denver lounge. Also there is a large poster in front of the lounge access offering United Credit Card Lounge Access for $500 a year.,Denver Airport,2.0,4,4,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,It was very comfortable a good selection of food and beverages. The lounge was tidy. Shower was good with good pressure. They could do with checking the aircon/ventilation as after the shower it felt like a sauna in there. Kind of defeated the purpose of having the shower in the first place. The staff on the counter and in the lounge were pleasant and efficient. Overall a good experience.,Hong Kong Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes
United Airlines,The United Club locations in Houston are actually pre-merger Continental President's Club locations. The facility is nice with over sized leather chairs in addition to traditional bar seating. The facility is very clean and still looks rather new although it's probably close to 10 years old. The third level has a smaller seating area but can be a nice get away from the busy setting on the second floor. My main complain about the United Club is the lack of food options and the tiny glasses used for sodas. Crackers and cheese really aren't worth the $400 yearly membership fee.,Houston Hobby Airport,4.0,4,3,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
United Airlines,Very friendly and attentive staff. A variety of seating options. Quiet. Fantastic view of the tarmac. Rated the bar/beverages a 4 compared to lounges generally but for an airport of this size the bar offerings are excellent. Typical United snacky food: carrots and dip cheese and crackers apples snack mix etc. Really like this lounge.,San Diego Airport,3.0,5,5,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,yes

United Airlines,Miserable selection of snack foods. Many chairs are worn through. Automatic sinks in the washrooms don't function properly. WIFI is the slowest I've encountered at any airline anywhere in the world. I've passed through this lounge regularly over the past 5 years when flying Singapore Airlines or Thai Airways and its exactly as I encountered it the first time only older and more threadbare.,Tokyo Narita Airport,2.0,2,3,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,no

United Airlines,Had a 4-hour layover in San Francisco and since I was connecting to a PS flight to JFK flying in Business Class I was granted free access to the United Club in Terminal 3. Reception was fast easy and the ladies were friendly enough. The entrance was grand and was welcoming. The lounge itself is of decent size the views of the runway are amazing and there were a decent amount of seating. Not the newest lounge but it was cozy enough. However as I've read before the food choices is a total disappointment. But I had bought my own food from the food court knowing this. There were some fruits crackers chips and some soda fountain and coffee machine. The soda tasted watered down but cappuccino was pretty decent. Free WiFi worked well and was fast had a nice seat with a powerport next to it by the window so overall a pleasant experience not the best lounge I've been but can't complain really.,San Francisco Airport,4.0,5,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,yes
United Airlines,Of all United Clubs I've visited this lounge is the probably the best. Very small and dated furniture but because it is tucked away in the International Terminal and services only one flight the crowds are small. Full breakfast served with juice quiche sandwiches wraps yogurt hot soup and full bar. All complimentary. If the domestic United Clubs took a tip from this small United lounge overseas the United Club would be much more on par with the service of other international carriers.,Melbourne Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,yes

United Airlines,Tired in need of a paint job. We find a comfortable seat then head to the food - very limited nothing to qualify for a morning meal but automatic beer glass fillers. After searching we discover another corner with some more food but not much - limited cereal biscuits a soup no toast or sandwiches In the toilets and NO amenities - no toothbrushes no combs no shave no towelettes the room is dirty.

United Airlines,Very small and crowded lounge downstairs near gate D8. Packed most of the time line at the bar was 3 deep and wi-fi was practically non-existent. A real dump compared to the United lounges at Newark or Houston. United should be ashamed of themselves.,Washington Dulles Airport,1.0,1,1,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,I used a one-time United Club pass issued as a credit card promotion to get in. I can't believe people would pay several hundred dollars a year for access. Food was nearly non-existent. The offerings were limited to a bowl of apples one flavor of yogurt cereal and a handful of shriveled miniature bagels that looked like they'd been recycled from the previous day. Juice was available only upon request at the bar (tips appreciated). Although the club provides wi-fi service it was not working when I was there. Only a few of the seating locations had access to electrical outlets. On the plus side the club was quiet probably because so few bother to use it.,Unknown,3.0,3,4,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,no
United Airlines,I have visited this lounge 3-4 times a year over the last 5+ years. I can truly say that this is the dirtiest United Club I have ever visited. The carpet (a cheap item to change) looks like livestock have been housed in the place. The men's bathroom has been out of order for 2 of my last four visits; the attendant instructed me to use the TAM lounge which required another check-in. The Internet is open without pesky log-in requirements but it is very very slow. The lounge is very busy from 8-10 so maybe the space simply cannot accommodate the traffic. I noted another comment that the lounge does not have adequate staffing so the tables when I get there are covered with empty glasses/dishes. Seems to me that United could do a lot better than this.,Sao Paulo Guarulhos Airport,2.0,2,1,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,Upon walking into the United Club Lounge at Chicago's O'Hare Terminal B (nearest B18 gate) this past Sunday it was the most reminiscent of a cold steely operating room at a major hospital rather than an airport lounge. Upon reaching the bottom of the escalator to the reception desk you could find a rather cold grey holding room with straight back chairs (none in leather) and utilitarian lighting. It looked like cheap IKEA furniture and fixtures filled the room. The most depressing lounge I have ever entered in the world and it just goes to show United never cared about it's elite customers and destroyed Continental's customer perks and more comfortable lounges. It was obvious to me every last penny was pinched at the frequent flier's expense. I left after a while to try the other lounge at B8 area and it was the same depressing room I experienced at the other end. Both expresso/cappuccino machines were broken and the bartenders had to be called from behind the wall to get a drink. Very depressing cheap bland lounges that felt like nothing more than gate-side seating in a large room behind a door. Shame on United.,Chicago O'Hare Airport,1.0,1,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,no
United Airlines,"I was in for a shock when I entered the United Lounge in LAX expecting to take a nice shower after a long flight from New Zealand. No showers!

United Airlines,There are various signs posted all over the lounge about excusing their appearance while they upgrade the lounge however this is simply not good enough taking away from the tired interior the badly stained carpets and unpleasant damp smell this lounge is probably the worst I have ever visited every empty surface was littered with dirty dishes rubbish and discarded newspapers. A welcome change was the sight of some food sadly the sandwiches were stale. The internet while free was painfully slow the desk agent spoke only with eye contact. If you have the option take the short (5mins) to terminal 2 and use either the Smiles or AA clubs.,Sao Paulo Guarulhos Airport,2.0,2,1,0.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,United Lounges are just sad. The Red Carpet Club is used for International Business. There is almost no food. The check-in staff was positively rude and unhelpful with long lines to get into the lounge. In the First Class Lounge the two staffers were typing typing typing. They were nice but not knowledgeable or helpful. First Class Lounge is like the business lounge but more empty and with slightly more food and drink available but certainly nothing impressive.,Washington Dulles Airport,2.0,4,3,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,Visited with my Priority Pass membership (not available to PP Select members) staff friendly enough visited the lounge in Terminal Very large up the escalator to the main level plenty of seating options including the bar work space areas TV theatre. Continued up to the next level much quieter however there is no bar on the upper level just self serve water and coffee. Soft drinks are only available (complimentary) via the bar service despite feeling slightly pressured to tip for my 5 cents worth of soda I did not. The food sorry snacks as is typical of United Clubs is poor - a selection of crackers with cheeses carrots fruit nuts etc. The best thing about this lounge for me was the availability of showers since I had a 5 hour layover here it was very welcome indeed. Wifi is free and no registration or codes were required.,Unknown,4.0,5,5,3.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
United Airlines,I went into the lounge hoping to see post-merger improvements (from the Continental days) and was disappointed to see no changes. They have the same rude unprofessional receptionists who immediately banned my friend from joining me as a guest in the lounge (with my first-class ticket) and asked for 50$. I understand this is their rule but it was not handled very well. The breakfast food was cheap and basic lounge was extremely crowded and noisy and it was difficult finding seats. I spent five minutes there and was happy to leave. I won't be returning to this lounge and I couldn't imagine paying for it. This facility isn't even in the same league as the lounges from other Star Alliance carriers.,Newark Airport,2.0,2,2,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,no

United Airlines,Red carpet club at C concourse. What a waste of time the only food was some nuts yoghurt raisins and some carrots. Hardly filling! They've now introduced a range of complimentary alcoholic beverages but the service is pretty mediocre.

United Airlines,This was the President's Club of Continental. I obtained access because I have Star Alliance Gold status and was on an international flight. However it took 10 minutes to get access because the reception staff member said my card's magnetic strip didn't state it was gold (although the card expressly states Star Gold and has never been refused before). Good selection of magazines poor selection of food (it was around 0800) with a few cereals and bagels and a couple of juices. Nothing hot besides coffee and tea. Free wifi but it seemed like a bit of a zoo definitely not worth waiting 10 minutes for. People taking long flights would be best using this lounge for the free wifi and then buy some food elsewhere in the terminal. Bathroom seemed well worn with loose lock on bathroom cubicle and significant signs of wear and tear.,Unknown,3.0,3,4,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,The new B concourse lounge quite nice though food and beverage far behind international lounges I have visited. Caters to Lufthansa pax who are a bit more savvy. (B18) Main B lounge crowded with poor snacks. C Concourse lounge better- more open with runway views but Untied employees still with (unearned) attitude- appear to be doing you a favor for joining and granting them jobs! International lounges in other nations are superior. Forget the F concourse lounge. Crowded stinky with minimal to no customer service. And I'm a 1 K member!,Chicago O'Hare Airport,2.0,2,2,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,Rarely have I encountered anywhere so uninspiring as the United lounge at SFO Intl. Decor and furniture are tired the layout is strange poorly sign posted and the food and beverage options are awful. No free wi-fi. I prefer to wait in one of the (admittedly average) bars in the terminal. As a separate note the first class lounge whilst comparing favourably to the business class lounge isn't much to write home about either.,San Francisco Airport,2.0,3,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,I dread every time I have to fly to Chicago because I know I will end up in this lounge on my return leg to the UK. This is simply the worst lounge I have been in - the staff are very rude and unhelpful unless you are buying premium drinks and likely to give them a tip. The girls on the front desk are rude and clearly badly trained the food offering is very poor. One would expect at least one or two hot meal offerings not packets of cheese slices and crackers. There are some complimentary drinks on offer but through the miserable bar staff who are visibly annoyed that you are not buying a premium drink. They are also served in small glasses and the quality of the wine is appalling. The physical environment in the lounge is not too bad so these seems simple problems to rectify.,Chicago O'Hare Airport,2.0,2,3,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,This lounge is an embarrassment. Seating areas are filthy. Food on offer is minimal and poor. And only one wifi card per person. So a traveler can only have one connected device at a time.,San Francisco Airport,2.0,2,1,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,A bit disappointed. My lasting memory will be the red covered pool table rather than the food or ambience? Shame it's a nice spot but let down by the limited choice of menu. The staff were friendly but working with limited resources in terms of food. Time to innovate?,New York JFK Airport,3.0,4,3,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,yes
United Airlines,What a shocker! This is the first business lounge I've ever been in where it is more luxurious to stay out in the rest of the airport. Tatty stained furniture threadbare carpets crumbs and rubbish on the floor and half drunk half eaten food left on the tables. Food that would be embarrassing to see served in a cheap motorway services.,San Francisco Airport,2.0,2,1,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,The lounge is clean and the wifi access worked well but the food offering is pathetic and consists entirely of unhealthy snacks. They should take a note of standards in other airline lounges and have at least two hot food items. Even Air Canada lounges have a hot soup.,Chicago O'Hare Airport,3.0,3,4,3.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,For a brand new lounge the internet was a disaster everyone was getting frustrated. I came to the lounge 3 hours before my flight to work what a waste of my time.,Cape Town Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,What a disgrace our first and definitely our last. Not quiet shortage of food shortage of drink empty soap dispensers in toilet generally not clean and dreadful WiFi. I guess I shouldn't be surprised the whole airport experience from moment of landing to leaving was horrid. When people pay thousands to travel first class we expect far better. We certainly expect better of Virgin Atlantic with whom we were traveling.,Miami Airport,2.0,3,2,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,This lounge needs redesigning with a wrecking ball. A place of peaceful relaxation - certainly not. Liquor - yes get drunk to avoid the disappointment. Service - what would that be? Food dodgy looking soup plus a few skinny sandwiches and biscuits. Wine - that'll be red or white then. Milk for tea. Oh ok- they found some - peculiar these Brits and they like it to be hot. Sitting in it right now resisting urge to send out for a pizza.,Miami Airport,2.0,1,4,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,Visited this lounge twice during this trip while connecting on the outbound and inbound trips. Both times the lounge was dirty the bathrooms filthy food not worth eating and the general atmosphere so unpleasant that it was better to wait by the gate.,Los Angeles Lax Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,ALL the lounges at Ohare leave a lot to be desired. Free drinks - but who can drink them? The entire bar smells so badly of disinfectant - and the glasses too - that I can barely drink there. I finally have gotten wise and ask for my drinks in the plastic cups. At least these don't smell like chemicals. So crowded and the food is terrible.,Chicago O'Hare Airport,2.0,3,2,1.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,In comparison to other RCC lounges this is quite reasonable. They have sandwiches salad and some cheese. Seating is a bit old. Lounge staff kind to me and my family. There is free but slow wifi. The selection of spirits is quite nice. It gets really crowded due to many Int'l departures from 8-10pm.,Sao Paulo Guarulhos Airport,3.0,3,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes

Virgin Atlantic Airways,Excellent lounge with very attentive staff. Lots of seating options and a good size dining area. Showers excellent. We found seats by the window with good views of the apron and runway. Food was great we had several items off the tapas menu to share.

United Airlines,"Simply put United is shoving its international business class customers in its ""bus terminal"" Red Carpet Club. It used to be a membership Club but is now available to persons buying day passes signing up for credit cards paying with points US Airways in fact virtually anyone with a pulse and money can now enter which means it's overcrowded. Showers didn't work the attendant said United doesn't maintain them. The lounge attendants are rude and unhelpful. Cheap drinks are on the house but not an open bar. Anything of quality must be paid for. A pretzel is United's definition of food. Absolutely abysmal.",Chicago O'Hare Airport,2.0,2,3,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,This lounge is the worst I have ever been in. Considering I paid nearly $5000 for my ticket the complimentary food on offer was limited and poor quality. The worst part of the experience was the bar staff who were very rude. I was here a year ago and I put it down to individual staff unfortunately the same miserable lady and gentlemen were still working there! They have serious attitude and seem to take a view that complimentary drinks are for cheapskates. Even though I regularly travel business next time I'm in O'Hare I will simply go to a paying bar where I can get service with a smile!,Chicago O'Hare Airport,2.0,3,3,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,This has to be the worst lounge I have ever had the misfortune to wait in. The charge was reasonable to enter but the lounge was hidden by stairwell so one can not see the disgrace one is paying for until it is too late. The drinks consist of cold coffee and a cappucino machine that has seen better decades. There is no hot food but some stale Bagels that if brave could be toasted in a machine that had not been cleaned out of crumbs since it was opened. Having said this I should not have been surprised after a 14 hour flight into SFO with United where they did one drinks run and two food runs. Most of the staff hid in the back until landing. The only break in boredom was the epsiode of asking for a G&T and being asked to pay for it having upgraded to premium economy.,San Francisco Airport,2.0,2,1,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,Just arrived home from LAX. Totally shocked at the way we have been treated as upper class passengers! We were made to walk from terminal 2 to terminal 3 so we could use a lounge. The Virgin Loft Lounge only caters for Shorthaul passengers - lacking any decent food (a cookie and a grape at best with cheese cut to the size for a mousetrap!) No showers small toilet and wash facilities. We have always used Air NZ lounge previously which was excellent. Virgin must rectify this situation quickly otherwise Upper Class passengers will seek alternatives. The shuttle bus ride back to term 2 was such an experience - we have now seen areas of the airport no one would want to see - trash bins cleaning vehicles etc (all part of the luxury upper class experience no doubt!),Los Angeles Lax Airport,1.0,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,Was offered the lounge as an alternative to the Air New Zealand lounge as an Upper Class Virgin Atlantic passenger. The lounge is poor in comparison to other lounges that I have experienced Bar is okay if a little limited but food is very poor - bread cheese soup and cookies No showers or changing facilities. No comparison with the Air New Zealand lounge at LAX or Virgin Lounge at Heathrow. Very disappointing!,Los Angeles Lax Airport,3.0,2,3,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,no
United Airlines,"Much too small for the number of people there - reception desk staff abrupt and uninterested until they made an announcement ""whoever left their drink at the reception desk please come and get it back"" - really?

United Airlines,Purchase of One Time Pass from United Airlines website. The lounge in Hong Kong is quite spacious and did not feel cramped when flights arrived and premium passengers used the lounge. Food options were plentiful and there was no shortage of drinks. The lounge has a deck over looking the terminal and views out over the tarmac. The United staff at the lounge were courteous and helpful. For the price of the pass it was well worth it.,Hong Kong Airport,4.0,4,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,no
United Airlines,There are two huge lounges both divided in two - like sitting in an aircraft hanger. Cluster of seats but no sound barriers - conversations and cell phone conversations can be heard everywhere. Very limited selection of snacks as they sell meals bookable at the service desk. Might as well have stayed in the departure lounge downstairs at the gate!,Denver Airport,2.0,2,3,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,Although we were transiting to Manchester we had over three hours at LHR and so decided to use the Arrivals Lounge. It was an excellent choice. The friendly staff on reception offered us showers immediately and after these we sat in the lounge and enjoyed an excellent tasty well cooked breakfast served by more friendly staff. The lounge was comfortable and clean with excellent shower rooms. The WiFi was slow at first but then speeded up to an acceptable level. It was a pleasure to be in this lounge after the grim lounge we had experienced on departure from Miami. The lounge was not crowded while we were there although given its size it could be if a lot of flights arrived together.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,yes
Virgin Atlantic Airways,As grim a lounge as I can recall for many years. A couple of apparently arguing staff on duty. The lounge was totally enclosed with no view of the outside and the seating was in my view not up to the standard you expect in a business class lounge. The food was nothing special pretzels cookies and when a few sandwiches appeared they were soon grabbed by the nearest passengers although they were edible. WiFi seemed to be an acceptable speed for what I needed. Toilets were adequate and clean (just about) although they had a strange smell. With only one flight a day I accept that Virgin's choice is limited but they really need to have words with Club America as this lounge does Virgin's reputation no good.,Miami Airport,3.0,3,3,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,Like earlier reviewers I found this lounge to be pretty disappointing. To the point that I was questioning if I was actually in the lounge or rather some 'general boarding but status' room. Limited drinks are free (points) but the food is really nonexistent. Packaged crackers and cheese carrot sticks and that's really it. Lots of space outlets available and free wi-fi (ask for card at the desk) this lounge leaves me wishing for more elitism feel (I did pay considerable dollars for my int'l biz seat- can't you up things wi some cut fruit more variety in snacks).,Chicago O'Hare Airport,2.0,3,1,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,"Awful place. Not recommended. Dirty. Complimentary wifi requires red club membership. Very basic snacks. Not even close to the very basic business class standards. Try to avoid.

United Airlines,This lounge is physical adequate and has a nice view of the runway and ramp. Free wifi offered. That's it for the positives. Negatives - simply the worst selection of food that I have ever seen for a premium class lounge. Carrots packaged in plastic of the genre one throws into a childs lunch box slices of monterey jack cheese also packaged in plastic. And a pitiful assortment of packaged cookies. This is so far below standard that it is insulting. Unfortunately this is the only lounge that Swiss business passengers can use at SFO.,San Francisco Airport,3.0,4,4,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,Worst lounge I have ever been in. Empty of staff empty of any food except pretzels and wifi so slow that when I tested the speed it came back with basically the equivalent of 56k dialup modem. Fine for the 1990s but just appalling. I know it's not Virgin's own lounge and with 1 flight a day they are not going to do anything about it but Club America ought to be ashamed.,Miami Airport,2.0,3,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,I was lucky enough to get access to this haven of peace and good vibe. The lounge is upbeat but relaxing music cool staff and gourmet food and champagne. All you need do is find a nice seat (plenty on offer) and a decent magazine and wave your hand and one of the cheerful young waiters/waitresses take your order. I enjoyed Lanson champagne with excellent choices of food.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Virgin Atlantic Airways,"Virgin Little Red lounges at Heathrow Terminal 1 and Edinburgh Airports are basically space in the Servisair Lounge. When the route LHR-Edinburgh started I could get into both lounges using my Singapore Airlines Gold Card as per normal Virgin lounges. At Terminal 1 in Heathrow it is a good 10-15 minute walk about as far apart as you can get in the terminal from lounge to gate. Three time I have been refused access here - you have to go back down the stairs go to the internal desk hope it is manned or the person is free get a pass from them and go back. it is more hassle than it is worth. In Edinburgh twice they said ""no"" then looked at a card document and realised it was ""yes"" but this apparently changes in September and the SQ card is no longer welcome there. Basically it's Virgin Gold or nothing - it would have been nice to communicate it. Whilst the in air product competes with BA on the routes on the ground they are poles apart. Sad to get driven back to using BA because of this.",London Heathrow Airport,2.0,3,2,3.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,It is relatively small but I was lucky enough to be one of only a handful of users. There is the same offering of food and drink there (bar service even for soft drinks horrendous cubes of cheese pretzels and that trail mix stuff) as every other RCC. There were no flight announcements which would have been nice. Unlike most airport lounges this one is completely enclosed as in no windows! It is located right next to the airport shuttle train underground.,Seattle Airport,3.0,3,4,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,no

United Airlines,This lounge was brutal. I had a First Class ticket to YYC which makes it an international flight and I expected decent service. I had to pay about $6 for a Sam Adams beer there. There was only cheese and crackers for food in spite of being there over supper hour. I expected soup or something of that variety. Lastly there was not wifi available there. The seating was old and worn out the lounge had dirty dishes on many of the tables and lacked newspapers.,San Francisco Airport,1.0,2,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,No staff on duty. Only pretzels or Cookies to eat. When you walk in its business ticket passengers to the right and others including priority pass to the left in a separate lounge.

United Airlines,Denver Red Carpet - while large - has some areas that leave something to be desired. Limited plugs. They could do a much better job ensuring that each seating cluster has plug in or access to one. One of the benefits of airline clubs is the convenience of not having to fight for outlets and this particular airline club has the same issue - something that surprised me for United's hub. Other airline clubs are much better on this front. Clean up service of old plates/glasses. Service to clean up old plates and other glassware is sporadic at best. I had to clean up my area before sitting and the table I moved them to has not been cleaned up in the two hours I have been here.,Denver Airport,3.0,3,2,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,What a dump! No food agents all had an attitude. Bar service only with some free drinks but If you do not leave a tip they look at you and you never get service. Bathrooms not clean at all. Plugs did not work. No seats. Old run down very bad..,Washington National Airport,1.0,1,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,Very tired and disappointing lounge. Not a First Class environment more akin to worn out frequent flier lounge circa 1990. Staff at desk demonstrates little interest or professionalism. The food offered is laughable. When compared to even the Air France Affaires or Virgin Upper Class Lounges at Dulles - both Business Class offerings - United's falls flat.,Washington National Airport,3.0,3,3,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,no

Virgin Atlantic Airways,"This is a shared lounge with Cathay Pacific and several others. It is also the type of lounge that appears to be accessed by anyone paying a nominal fee or having a paid-for lounge pass. As such it was absolutely crowded out - we got two of the last seats available on a Thursday afternoon. There was nothing to eat apart from soup (unnamed) and crisps and only quarter bottles of indifferent wine (the white ran out about an hour after we arrived) with a few general spirits such as G&T. This is not a proper business lounge of the type you would expect from Virgin and we were very very disappointed. There were no UK papers hardly any magazines and the room was small and cramped. We watched people come in walk around looking for a seat and then leave again. I asked the woman on the reception desk what happened when the lounge was full and she told me that she ""sent them away"". When I asked where to she replied ""out of here"". Chicago is not a small airport in the middle of nowhere it is an important international hub and as such business passengers should be provided with facilities to match the price paid.",Chicago O'Hare Airport,2.0,1,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,Had access due to codeshare with Air New Zealand. Actually a pleasant spot although limited selection of food and beverage but more than adequate.

Virgin Atlantic Airways,This was the worst lounge experience I have ever had. My wife and I arrived for a 12.30pm flight to Cancun at about 9am. The lounge was practically empty There were a few holiday makers. There were no help yourself drinks - you had to ask for an alcoholic beverage. The spectacular view of the runway was a row of industrial air vents on a roof. The cooked breakfast would not have fed a sparrow. I went to get my free spa treatment to be told that they could fit me in at 3pm. This was 10 am - a bit problematic considering that I would be half way across the Atlantic at the time. So my wife and I had no free spa treatment. There was one lady getting her nails done but the problem was that there were no staff around - probably did not want to pay them overtime on Easter Saturday. To cap it all I went to the loo and there was a disgusting smell of smoke as somebody had been in there smoking. Considering we were offered the exclusive privilege of being in there for the princely sum of £50 each I just did not rate it at all. Very disappointing indeed - stay clear unless it's free!,London Gatwick Airport,2.0,4,3,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,We arrived at the airport very early had small snack from Gravlax counter/salad bar. Excellent choices and very tasty. Very pleasant service from waiters. Good changing facilities for baby. Main meal of curry with very decent Merlot. All very relaxed and nice to get out of way before night flight. My wife got hair treatment. Staff food and drink quality and the extras of beauty salon/ barbers all made the start of trip very easy.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes
Virgin Atlantic Airways,Shoe polish free spa treatments or free haircut in the salon. Then off for a shower if you so wish then find a seat and the waiter will attend your beverage requirements. The food choices are amazing they have a full Deli counter or you can choose from the extensive food menu. After this you can play pool or retire in the library while the kids can play in the softplay. And the best bit is you can check in as many hours before as you like we have a connecting flight from the North so we always take a flight early in the morning so we can spend longer in the Virgin lounge.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
United Airlines,This lounge leaves a great deal to be desired. I visited on New Years Eve when there was not much traffic in the lounge which is probably the only nice thing worth mentioning. The catering was appalling and range of drinks very limited since several machines were out of order. There were no newspapers and the very few magazines in the lounge were a few months old. I am sure this place was decent in the 1970's but it has not seen much upgrade ever since. Since I find United to be the worst US airline by far this lounge did nothing to change my point of view. On a final note if you are considering paying 50 USD to enter the lounge (ie. if you do not hold credentials to give you free access) I would seriously recommend you to stay way from this stale and tame lounge.,San Francisco Airport,1.0,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,Not as grand as LHR but present staff food and drinks are fine the only issue is sharing with other airlines can become very crowded. It is clean and comfortable.,Boston Logan Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,yes

Virgin Atlantic Airways,Paid £125 to book into the clubhouse - but ended up spending an hour on an over crowded bench eating junk food in the terminal as the clubhouse would not let us in (they had lost our booking). Basically it would have been cheaper and less stressful to rip up a £10 note and throw it around every five minutes before the flight. Staff unhelpful and Virgin not interested in refunding or helping despite nearly two months of trying.,London Heathrow Airport,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,United Airlines Red Carpet Club first class/business lounge is in short 'lame'. Plenty of room but you are treated only to a diet of the type of nuts and bar snacks you'd find at the corner tavern. You are issued two drink tickets which are good for one drink (go figure) and that's it. Free Wi-Fi : big deal. That is it.

Virgin Atlantic Airways,I'm currently sitting in the lounge. Only 3 other passengers in here so I'm wondering if there is another Virgin lounge here as this one is abysmal. No food whatsoever.

Virgin Atlantic Airways,They provide a Meet and greet service upon arrival  we were expedited through immigration and customs and taken out to our taxi. Upon departure we were meet at our taxi  checked in and assisted through Immigration security and to the lounge -there is a small fee.

Very welcoming and friendly efficient staff.,Unknown,4.0,5,4,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,Pretty basic normal Club America standard. This facility is used as a shared lounge by Virgin and British Airways. Quite comfortable and well laid out small business centre with a couple of terminals free wi-fi available. Soup and a few sandwiches available they seem to run out of these at regular intervals but rather than just getting more made appear to fill them once an hour. The problem is that if there is a sudden influx the sandwiches soon disappear but you may have to wait 45 minutes for them to bring in any more. Drinks not too bad spirits and beer ok a couple each of reds and whites more in fridges if you scratch around. Soft drinks are from large two litre bottles can be a bit flat - coffee and tea available with a dish of cookies. All on self service. If you are a bit hungry then you may do well to eat before security and then use the lounge for a relax and drink. The eating on air side is dreadful - Burger King Pizza and Panini is all that's available.,Miami Airport,2.0,4,4,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,Was challenged as to my eligibility to enter although I am Star Gold on an international routing then grudgingly let in but I wasn't missing much. Plenty of staff doing next to nothing can see no reason why there are 8 people in this lounge when it charges for any decent food and drink several staff just stand around doing nothing. The worst is the excuse for snacks which comprises a platter of cubed American style (ie rubber) cheese of three different colours under a lid with a selection of crackers. Wifi not free. Why does United bother? It may as well get rid of all staff bar an entry guard and cleaner and just let it be a quiet place to sit. The real disgrace is that you can't take bought food from elsewhere into this lounge presumably because you are meant to buy United airlines paninis.,Washington Dulles Airport,2.0,3,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

Virgin Atlantic Airways,An oasis of calm in HKIA. Attentive staff make sure that your drink is always full and that you have food - which is good - when you want it.,Hong Kong Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,no
United Airlines,What a disgrace. I am going to have to spend six hours in this lounge to catch a connecting flight to South Africa -the plug points don't work even bottled water costs money as does the wireless and staff is rude and uninformed. I am a regular user of Star Alliance lounges and while the quality varies from airport to airport this is by far the most appalling one I have ever seen. An insult to gold members.,Washington Dulles Airport,3.4,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,no
United Airlines,What a depressing place. After checking in we were informed the lounge would still close at scheduled time in spite of our flight to SYD being delayed more than an hour. Several announcements were made to push everyone out by 10:30. Our flight wound up boarding about an hour later. The seats are old and run down. Lighting is bad. Food is cheap snacks served in disposable containers. It reminded me of a college dormitory cafeteria between meals but the dormitory would have better choices. We wound up eating snack mix and yogurt covered pretzels. We were given two coupons apiece for drinks. Seats are old and beaten up. The bathroom is clearly old and run down. I can't explain it but there is a sad feeling to the place. I think we would have had a better time just going to and staying at the gate.,San Francisco Airport,1.0,2,3,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,"I was eager to try the newly renovated Clubhouse. About the second nicest lounge I have used and the most stylish. Seating comfortable cooked breakfast good plenty of room and the business centre provides laptops as well as wifi. There is a Cowshed spa - and here is my only criticism. The old lounge had perfectly good complementary spa treatments and offered free shaves and haircuts. Cowshed charges for most of its services and offers only massages facials and related therapies: great if you just want pampering but useless to a busy male flier like me who just wants to look his best at the other end of his flight. Also there is no ""revivals"" lounge at Gatwick - and Virgin do not have their own lounge in Orlando.",London Gatwick Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,Kenya Duty Free First Class Lounge. Virgin really need to do something about this lounge. It is a shared lounge but dreadful - words cannot adequately describe it. A dingy windowless room with worn out old leather sofas. Terrible selection of drinks and nibbles. A handful of several day old newspapers. Dial up internet pc was so slow I gave up.,Nairobi Airport,2.0,2,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no
United Airlines,"An absolute disgrace we had to pay for a beer and a glass of wine and the ""food"" on offer was disgusting. Sweaty cubes of cheese and something unidentifiable in large glass tubes which looked like coloured marbles. Considering the extortionate price charged by United for business class seats they need to do much better than this. The lounge at San Francisco was only marginally better in that we were given 2 vouchers each for alcohol.",Unknown,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,This is one of the saddest lounges I've used. I'm traveling on Air Canada and originally was turned away because they wouldn't recognize my Executive First ticket and told me I needed Star Alliance Gold membership. Then at the gate the Air Canada gate personnel overheard me saying I needed to find some wi-fi and he suggested I try the lounge. I told him I had been turned away he helpfully called down got into a discussion about the business class eligibility and sent me down. No cocktails - there's a bar but it's unstaffed and the only drinks are a few diet cokes and some bloody mary mix. A few apples and bags of chips complete the offering. Most unhelpfully since I'm not a Red Carpet Club member I had to buy my own wifi access on t-mobile. This contradicts the info on the little placard that says t-mobile wifi is available on a complimentary basis to international customers. Well last time I checked Toronto was in Canada not the US. The bathroom is dingy grey the tiles are dirty and I swear there's graffiti and scratching on the door to one of the stalls. The lounge seating area is nice enough but they need to make more of an effort to make this more than just a glorified waiting area. I certainly wouldn't pay $400 a year to use these facilities.,Philadelphia Airport,2.0,3,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,Lounge is vast and well appointed but you realize quickly that it's full of people and seating is at a premium. The shower facility is fine with a nice amenities/toiletries bag given out. Food consists of snacks like saltines cheese bananas a few sushi rolls and nuts. Not much more and the beverage selection is standard cafeteria. You would do better to use the ANA Business lounge that is located very close to United RCC if you're a Star Alliance Gold Member. There ANA has a nice selection of refreshments including a Sake Bar soups sandwiches and a kitchen where you can walk up and order various noodles. There is free WiFi.,Tokyo Narita Airport,3.0,3,3,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,Cowshed is great laze around in a jacuzzi shower have your suit pressed and shoes cleaned. Sit at the bar eat a meal at the restaurant. Deli counter for lighter bites. Great drinks great staff and viewing areas. Pool table and cinema sized screen with lazyboy chairs. A sanctuary at Heathrow airport loved it!,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,Only one daily flight from JNB to LHR for Virgin so lounge is not huge. It is however very classy and has most things needed. There is a full menu or drinks and food several options which are all freshly prepared and very nice. Several shower rooms to freshen up. Business suite with three computers free internet etc. Comfortable private seating areas and a sit up bar. Table and chairs if you would rather eat at a table. Nice looking lounge and works well. Long way to gate for flight 10 mins I'd guess,Johannesburg Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
United Airlines,One of the worst Red Carpet Club I ever visit. Rude welcome personnel. I used this Club because the First Class Lounge is too far to the Air Canada gate. The personnel don't know that Star Alliance Business Class travellers can use Red Carpet Club and ask for Red Carpet Membership. It's a very big difference between the United Lounge in Hong Kong and the Business Lounge in Chicago ORD. And don't bother about the food and beverage - it's almost nothing.,Chicago O'Hare Airport,1.0,1,2,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,Very courteous welcome. Breakfast choice is OK but choice of drinks is limited. No Internet only from the Airport Internet provider but the people who had paid an overprice fee said it doesn't work. Access to the Club by 2 very old elevators is very slow so don't wait too close to your departure because there is another long line security check at the gate.,Paris CDG Airport,2.0,2,3,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,Absolutely fantastic facility. We were delayed 8 hours at Gatwick on our way to Vegas. Staff in the V Room could not have been better - food and drink provided throughout the day and no queue for the toilets. Staff even kept the lounge open late to provide us with a haven away from all the fraught tempers downstairs. If you are able to access this lounge it is worth the cost - especially if you are delayed. We travelled with an 8 year old who didn't complain once and was kept entertained with facilities on offer.,London Gatwick Airport,4.0,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,There is no food at all and you are forbidden to bring food that you may have purchased elsewhere into the lounge. The staff were not very helpful when I asked if there were any newspapers to read - I was advised that if I couldn't find one they must have all been taken. Its a shame that Virgin and British Airways have to use this facility - its only the second time I have used this lounge and wouldn't bother again we cleared our own table which did seem to prompt the staff to clean other tables that had been left.,Orlando Airport,2.0,2,1,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,Fantastic. Got breakfast included drinks also. Could have had a glass of champagne but as not a drinker so missed out! Funky washrooms - unisex so be aware. Staff polite friendly.,London Gatwick Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,First time user of LHR Clubhouse and very impressed. Shown the various areas by a staff member and looked around ourselves before deciding on a seat viewing the runway. Firstly deposited bag and given a ticket to collect it prior to boarding. There were many different types of seating areas: cafe style; by Tv; in library; lounge style; child area; IT area - lots of choice. Chose a wicker hanging chair and sofa behind bar and ordered chicken curry and burger and champagne and espresso martini. The food came first with drinks shortly after. Had another drink and then went for our pre-booked shave and manicure in the cowshed. Found a seat in the same area following our treatments and had another couple of drinks and a dessert.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,This is a new lounge dedicated solely to Virgin Atlantic. Not too impressed on the first visit very little food on offer a few crackers two types of rather solid or stale bread cheese and a type of ham. This was before one of VA's sleeper flights we were warned at check in that a hot meal would not be served to us as we were located at the front on the upper class cabin how you are supposed to exist on this baffles me. The drinks are pretty poor as well only two white wines on offer tasted both - in my opinion undrinkable went for the 'champagne' a californian sparkling wine. did manage one glass but resisted going back for another. The staff pointed out that there was only one diet coke left they would not have any more until Monday (this was Thursday afternoon). In all the lounge was very crowded by the time the flight was called. If part of upper class fares are to cover the lounge then this is not good value. A general lack of toilets needed to queue to use.,Boston Logan Airport,2.0,3,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,Smallish lounge although with only 1 Virgin flight a day this no surprise. Felt a littel crowded on this full flight in Upper Class. Nice design - deli feel with plentiful drinks selection and reading materials. Staff ranged from pleasant to fairly disinterested. Food selection a little limited - expected more hot choices but clam chowder was delicious. Flight delayed which not announced until fairly late.,Boston Logan Airport,4.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,This lounge makes a night flight work. Check-in early complete all outstanding work issues here rather than the office. Wander over to the bar and have a champagne while contemplating the menu at the restaurant. Enjoy a freshly cooked rather than reheated food and wine tasting as it should at a table as opposed to your seat. If you want a haircut or massage these too are available.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,Very impressed with Virgin's Clubhouse at Heathrow. The lounge was quiet spacious and well laid out. Food was excellent. I took advantage of the Cowshed and booked a wet shave - great way to start a morning flight. Staff were very attentive. Overall experience was good - a very relaxing start to my trip.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,Early morning and an early start meant the lounge was very quiet. It was a pleasure to use. Food was excellent high quality and staff generally very attentive. Very pleasant and relaxing start to the journey. Highly recommended.,London Heathrow Airport,5.0,5,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,no
Virgin Atlantic Airways,I found the staff very helpful at all times. The food and drink selection was very good with the option of having dinner before the flight. Bathroom & shower facilities were excellent and kept very clean. Its locality to the departure gate was excellent with only a 2 minute walk to endure. Overall very good.,Hong Kong Airport,4.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no
